<h3><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></a></h3>


<p>William Wycherley was, before
Congreve arose to surpass him, the
most eminent master of that artificial
school of Comedy which commenced
with the restoration of
Charles II., and which may be said to have
perished, in a blaze as of a funeral pyre, with
Sheridan. Abandoning the beaten paths of
English drama, the writers of this school found, in
the various intrigue of the Spanish theatre, in the
verbal vivacity and piquant satire of the French, a
new basis for their productions. Their works, as a
class, have been designated the Comedy of
Manners, a title which aptly distinguishes them
from the Comedy of Human Life, set forth by
Shakespeare. It is a title, nevertheless, of limited
applicability. The manners portrayed in these
comedies, if drawn from the life, illustrate but one
side of human character, and that side the most
superficial. To divert by wit and ingenuity being
the writer's aim, all allusion to the deeper
motives of humanity was rejected as impertinent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
or admitted only as an occasional contrast to the
prevailing tone. Thus the artificiality of the
characters is the consequence rather of incompleteness
than of untruth; they are, as it were, but
half characters; the dialogue is no longer, as with
Shakespeare, the means of their development, but
the purpose of their creation.</p>

<p>Living in an age of loose manners and corrupt
morals, the result, as has often been pointed out,
of the unnatural state of repression which accompanied
the Puritan supremacy, Wycherley cannot
be acquitted of the vices of his time, nor
can it be contended that it was altogether with
the object of lashing these vices that he decked
them out with all the allurements of brilliant
dialogue and diverting situations. Yet I venture
to assert that, in spite of their licentiousness, these
comedies possess claims to recognition not lightly
to be ignored. Nay, more: that their very indecency,
although the most open, is certainly not
the most pernicious form of immorality known to
us in literature. For as the harm of licentious
allusions consists in their appeal to the basest
passions of human nature, so the appeal is
stronger as the impression of human passion is
deeper. But these <i>simulacra</i>, these puppet semblances
of humanity, which Wycherley and his contemporaries
summon upon the stage for our
diversion, what human passion can we discover
in these to which we should be in danger of
unworthily responding? As we read the plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
no sense of reality disturbs us. Transfer the
language they employ, the actions they perform,
to the characters in a play of Shakespeare's, a
novel of Richardson's, and our resentment and
detestation are instantly awakened. But the
<i>dramatis personæ</i> of Wycherley or of Congreve are
not, as the characters of Shakespeare and Richardson,
men and women whom we feel to be as real
and living as those with whom we daily associate.
They merely simulate humanity so far as is
requisite for the proper enactment of their parts.
And herein lies the test: a Cordelia, an Iago, a
Clarissa, a Lovelace, are, to our feelings, real
creatures of flesh and blood, whom we love or hate,
as the case may be. The characters of Wycherley
and Congreve, on the contrary, we neither love nor
detest; we are interested not in what they are, but
only in what they say and do. They have no
further existence for us than as they act and
speak on the stage before our eyes; touch them,
and, like ghosts in Elysium, they turn to empty
air in our grasp.</p>

<p>Another counter-influence to the unwholesomeness
of these comedies is the current of mirth which
runs through them, more or less, from end to end. For
laughter may be reckoned in some sort an antidote
to sensuality, at least to sensuality in its vilest and
most insinuating mood. "There is no passion,"
as Sterne says, "so serious as lust;" and we may
safely conclude that when laughter is provoked,
the wit of expression or the ludicrousness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
situation is more active to our apprehension than
the license of sentiment.</p>

<p>It is sometimes urged against the comedies of
this school that Virtue, in them, is brought on the
stage only to be derided. But this charge is
manifestly unjust. Virtue, indeed, is an unfrequent
guest in this house of mirth; she finds a refuge in
the house of mourning hard by, in the tragedies of
the times. Yet if she chance to cross the unwonted
threshold, it is not to be laughed out of
countenance, but more often to be entertained as
an honoured guest. Take, for instance, the
character of Christina, in Wycherley's <i>Love in a
Wood</i>, or even that of Alithea, in <i>The Country
Wife</i>; the sentiments of honour and purity that
are set on their lips, or expressed in their actions,
are evidently intended to excite our esteem and
admiration. Nay, it may even be affirmed that if,
among these shadowy creatures, there be any that
affect us, beyond the others, with some sense of an
approach to living reality, it is precisely the
virtuous characters from whom such an impression
is derived. It is true, on the other hand, that the
sin of adultery, so common to the dramatic plots of
this period, is treated not only without severity,
but as a pleasant jest. To the husbands, in general,
small mercy is shown. Yet what husbands are
these&mdash;these Pinchwifes, Fondlewifes, <i>et hoc genus
omne</i>? It is less the sanctity of marriage that is
attacked, or held up to ridicule, in their persons,
than their own vices, their jealousy, tyranny, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
folly. And, after all, it is by no means in the
crime itself, but in the ingenuity of intrigue, that
we are expected to find diversion; and the utter
absence of genuine passion on the part of these
stage criminals renders any appeal to passion in
ourselves out of the question.</p>

<p>It is not with any intention of excusing the
license which abounds in Wycherley's comedies
that I have ventured to offer these few considerations
in their behalf. I contend only that their
laughing outrages upon decency, are infinitely less
harmful, because more superficial, than the sentimental
lewdness which, arising from a deeper
depravity, instils a more subtle venom; that,
condemn it as we needs must, we may yet stop
short of attaching to the immorality of the
dramatists of the Restoration such consequence
as to debar ourselves, for its sake, from enjoying to
the full the admirable wit and ingenuity which
constitute the chief merit of their performances.</p>

<p>Wycherley produced but four comedies, which,
however, contain almost all of intrinsic value that
remains from his pen. Besides these, he himself
published but one volume, a folio of <i>Miscellany-Poems</i>,
which appeared in 1704, when the author
was sixty-four years of age. Of these pieces
nothing favourable can be affirmed even by the
friendliest critic. They form a strange <i>olla
podrida</i> of so-called philosophy and obscenity;
they are dull without weight, or lewd without wit;
or if even here and there a good thought occur, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
ore is scarcely of such value as to be worth the
pains of separating from the dross. The book
suggests a curious picture of the veteran dramatist,
ever and anon laying aside his favourite Rochefoucauld
or Montaigne to chuckle feebly over the
reminiscence of some smutty story of his youthful
days. The versification is, as Macaulay says,
beneath criticism; Wycherley had no spark of
poetry in his whole composition. In fine, we may
apply to this volume, without qualification, Dryden's
remarks upon poor Elkanah Settle; "His style is
boisterous and rough-hewn; his rhyme incorrigibly
lewd, and his numbers perpetually harsh and ill-sounding."
Yet there is one thing which redeems
the volume from utter contempt, as a testimony,
not, indeed, to the author's talent, but to the
constancy and disinterestedness of his temper. I
refer to the brave verses addressed to his friend the
Duke of Buckingham, on the occasion of that
versatile nobleman's disgrace and imprisonment in
the Tower. The key note is struck in the opening
lines:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Your late Disgrace is but the Court's Disgrace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As its false accusation but your Praise."</span><br />
</p>

<p>These lines, it may be remarked, are intended as
a rhymed couplet, and may serve as one instance
out of many of the "incorrigible lewdness" of
Wycherley's rhyme; but, paltry as the verses may
be, the feeling which prompted them was surely
deserving of respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The pieces in prose and verse, which, "having
the misfortune to fall into the hands of a mercenary,
were published in 1728, in 8vo, under the title of
<i>The Posthumous Works of William Wycherley Esq.</i>,"
are on the whole superior to the <i>Miscellany-Poems</i>,
yet, excepting perhaps some of the prose aphorisms
which constitute the first part of the collection,
little or nothing is to be found, even here, worth
resuscitating. Such facility or occasional elegance
as the verses possess must be wholly ascribed
to the corrections of Pope; but Pope himself
failed in the impracticable attempt to make a
silk purse out of a sow's ear. Some few of the
best pieces, as the lines on <i>Solitude</i>, might possibly
pass muster as the worst in a better volume,
while the epistle to Dryden (who had invited
Wycherley's collaboration in the construction of
a comedy&mdash;an honour which the younger author
gratefully and modestly declined) is interesting
personally, and the strain of elaborate compliment,
to which, after the fashion of the day,
Wycherley treated his correspondents, is here,
for once, not wholly misapplied. The <i>Maxims</i>,
however, contain better stuff than the verses, and
fully justify Pope's repeated hints to the author
that "the greater part" of his pieces "would make
a much better figure as single maxims and reflections
in prose, after the manner of your favourite
Rochefoucauld, than in verse."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Although, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
most part, as trite as moral aphorisms usually are,
they are not without here and there a touch of
wit, of terseness, or even of wisdom. Here, for
instance, is a pretty simile:&mdash;"False friends, like
the shadow upon a dial, are ever present to the
sunshine of our fortunes, and as soon gone when
we begin to be under a cloud." Here, again, is a
touch of characteristic satire:&mdash;"Old men give
young men good counsel, not being able longer to
give them bad examples."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And for a specimen of
his wisdom take the following:&mdash;"The silence of a
wise man is more wrong to mankind than the
slanderer's speech."</p>

<p>I have now noticed all that has appeared in
print of Wycherley's authorship beyond his letters
to Pope (which possess at least the merit of
occasioning Pope's letters to Wycherley), and a
few letters of earlier date, published by Dennis,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
which contain, however, nothing of more consequence
than a string of extravagant and affected
encomiums upon his correspondent. Something
remains to be said on the subject of our author's
personal character, which I shall endeavour to set
in a juster light than that in which it is presented
by Macaulay, whose vivid scrutiny, like a strong
torch-light, brings out the worse parts into sharp
relief, while it leaves the better in dense obscurity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
It is not to be doubted that Wycherley participated
in the fashionable follies and vices of the age in
which he lived. His early intrigue with the
Duchess of Cleveland was notorious. The license
of his own writings is a standing witness against him,
and the indecency of some of the verses which he
published in his old age proves that his mind reverted
to the scenes of his youth with feelings other than
those of a repentant sinner. Yet in accepting
the evidence of Wycherley's writings we should
beware of over-rating its importance. Dryden's
character is well known as that of a modest and
excellent man; yet Dryden occasionally produced
passages abundantly obscene. Libertinism was
the fashion of the age, and although the fashion had
somewhat changed when Wycherley published his
<i>Miscellany-Poems</i>, we can feel little surprise that
the productions of an aged and infirm man should
be redolent rather of the days when he was crowned
with honours and sated with success, than of those
later years of ill-health and obscurity. In this
man's composition the clay was assuredly mingled
with pure metal. Nothing in the testimony of his
contemporaries is so striking as the tone of affection
and esteem which they continually assume in
speaking of him. Dryden writes to John Dennis
that he has laid aside his intention of commenting
upon some friend's purpose of marriage; "for,
having had the Honour to see my Dear Friend
Wycherley's Letter to him on that occasion, I find
nothing to be added or amended. But as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
I love Mr. Wycherley, I confess I love myself so
well, that I will not shew how much I am inferior to
him in Wit and Judgment, by undertaking anything
after him."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And Dryden's regard was
gratefully and cordially reciprocated. In his first
letter to Wycherley Pope refers to the high satisfaction
which he experienced in hearing the old
dramatist, at their very first meeting, "doing justice
to his dead friend, Mr. Dryden." Wycherley's own
epistle, in verse, to the great poet I have already
mentioned; it is filled with expressions, sincere if
exaggerated, of regard and admiration; and long
after Dryden's death, in an essay<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which appeared
not until its author had, himself, been years in his
grave, Wycherley writes of "my once good friend,
Mr. Dryden, whose Memory will be honour'd when
I have no Remembrance."</p>

<p>His attachment to his friends, indeed, appears to
have been a prominent characteristic of his disposition.
Major Pack, in a short memoir prefixed to
the <i>Posthumous Works</i>, declares that "he was as
impatient to hear his Friend calumniated, as some
other people would be to find themselves defamed.
I have more than once," he adds, "been a witness
of that honourable Tenderness in his Temper."</p>

<p>His friendship with Pope is one of the best
known incidents in his life. It commenced in 1704,
when Wycherley was sixty-four and Pope but
sixteen years of age, and, although at times interrupted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
terminated only with the death of the
former in 1715. Their correspondence displays on
both sides the marks of sincere regard. Wycherley's
generous appreciation the young genius repaid
with gratitude and affection, which, however, in the
moments even of its warmest ardour, never degenerated
into servility. The last published letter
between them is dated May 2, 1710. It was
succeeded by a period of prolonged estrangement.
During the preceding year a silence of unusual
duration on the part of Wycherley had aroused the
anxiety of Pope, who alludes to it, in his correspondence
with their common friend Cromwell, in
terms of heart-felt concern. Wycherley had been
dangerously ill, and Cromwell had acquainted Pope
with the news of his recovery.</p>

<p>"You have delivered me," he replies, under
date of Oct. 19, 1709, "from more anxiety than
he imagines me capable of on his account, as I
am convinced by his long silence. However the
love of some things rewards itself, as of Virtue,
and of Mr. Wycherley. I am surprised at the
danger you tell me he has been in, and must
agree with you that our nation would have lost in
him as much wit and probity, as would have
remained (for aught I know) in the rest of it. My
concern for his friendship will excuse me (since I
know you honour him so much, and since you know
I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my
uneasiness to you, and tell you that there has not
been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
of me to Mr. Wycherley, which, I fear, may have
had some effect upon him."</p>

<p>The correspondence was renewed, with all the
old kindness, in the following spring, but was
soon again to be interrupted. Pope had, for
some years, been engaged upon the occasional
correction and emendation of Wycherley's worse
than mediocre verses, and the unsparing honesty
with which he discharged this delicate office,
however creditable to his character, could not but
be at times unpalatable to the author now seventy
years of age, and rendered peevish by ill-health
and loss of memory. His last published letter
to Pope betrays some natural indignation at the
wholesale slaughter which the young poet was
making of his halting lines, although, with the
politeness of an old courtier, he thanks him for his
freedom, which he "shall always acknowledge with
all sort of gratitude." It is probable, also, that
some enemy of Pope had again possessed the old
man's ear with slanders, to which his shattered
memory would render him the more accessible, and
Wycherley again broke off the correspondence,
leaving his friend to wonder how he had displeased
him, as knowing himself "guilty of no offence but
of doing sincerely just what he bid me."</p>

<p>Pope's references to Wycherley, during this new
estrangement, show him to have been deeply hurt.
They indicate, however, more of sorrow than of
resentment, and his delight was unfeigned when, in
the autumn of 1711, his friend was once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
reconciled to him, and once more wrote to him and
spoke of him in terms of the warmest affection.
Cromwell, from whose correspondence with Pope
we derive our information regarding this second
reconciliation narrates the following pleasant incident.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wycherley came to town on Sunday last,
and, kindly surprised me with a visit on Monday
morning. We dined and drank together; and I
saying, 'To our loves,' he replied, 'It is Mr. Pope's
health.'" On these terms we leave them. Their
correspondence of this date has not been made
public, nor do we know if malice or misunderstanding
again destroyed the concord thus happily
re-established. Pope's letters to Cromwell, moreover,
cease about this time, and those which he
addressed to others contain no further mention of
Wycherley, until in January 1716, he describes to
Mr. Blount the closing scene of the life of "that
eminent comic poet, and our friend."</p>

<p>In after years, speaking of Wycherley, Pope
said: "We were pretty well together to the last:
only his memory was so totally bad, that he did not
remember a kindness done to him, even from minute
to minute. He was peevish, too, latterly; so that
sometimes we were out a little, and sometimes in.
He never did an unjust thing to me in his whole
life; and I went to see him on his death-bed."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>One more of his contemporaries I propose to
bring forward as a witness to our author's character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
George Granville, Baron Lansdowne, to the ordinary
qualifications of an accomplished gentleman added
some pretensions, not altogether contemptible, to
the rank of a minor poet. He was the author of a
vast number of elegantly written verses (usually
addressed to "Mira"), of a tragedy (<i>Heroic Love</i>)
commended by Dryden, and of an amusing comedy
(<i>Once a Lover and always a Lover</i>) of the school of
Wycherley and Congreve. In the second volume
of his collected works is to be found an epistle in
which he remarks, with some minuteness, upon
the character and disposition of his friend
Wycherley.</p>

<p>This letter is not dated, but, from internal
evidence, must have been written about the
year 1705 or 1706. Lansdowne sets out with
declaring that his partiality to Wycherley as a
friend might render what he says of him suspected,
"if his Merit was not so well and so publickly
established as to set him above Flattery. To do
him barely Justice," he continues, "is an Undertaking
beyond my Skill." Further he writes: "As
pointed and severe as he is in his Writings, in his
Temper he has all the Softness of the tenderest
Disposition; gentle and inoffensive to every Man
in his particular Character; he only attacks Vice as
a publick Enemy, compassionating the Wound he
is under a Necessity to probe." Yet, "in my
Friend every Syllable, every Thought is masculine;"
and it was, questionless, from this particularity
that he acquired the sobriquet (alluding, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
the same time, to <i>The Plain Dealer</i>) of <i>Manly</i>
Wycherley. Of our Plain Dealer as a poet
Lansdowne candidly confesses&mdash;"It is certain he is
no Master of Numbers; but a Diamond is not less
a Diamond for not being polish'd." And then,
addressing his correspondent: "Congreve," he
writes, "is your familiar Acquaintance, you may
judge of Wycherley by him: they have the same
manly way of Thinking and Writing, the same
Candour, Modesty, Humanity, and Integrity of
Manners: It is impossible not to love them for their
own Sakes, abstracted from the Merit of their
Works." In conclusion Lansdowne invites his
correspondent to his lodging, to meet Wycherley,
as well as "a young Poet, newly inspired," whose
"Name is Pope," who "is not above seventeen or
eighteen years of age, and promises Miracles," and
whom Wycherley and Walsh "have taken under
their Wing."</p>

<p>The foregoing testimonies are, I venture to think,
sufficiently explicit. Johnson, indeed, supposes
Wycherley to have been "esteemed without virtue,
and caressed without good-humour," but a statement
so obviously self-contradictory deserves no
consideration. One thing is clear: that Wycherley
was both beloved and honoured by men whose
temper and capacity give irrefragable authority to
their judgment, and that judgment, based, as it was
upon personal and intimate acquaintance, it were
presumption to dispute.</p>

<h3><i><a name="WILLIAM_WYCHERLEY" id="WILLIAM_WYCHERLEY">WILLIAM WYCHERLEY.</a><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></i></h3>


<p>William Wycherley was born in 1640. He
was the son of a Shropshire gentleman of old
family,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and of what was then accounted a good
estate. The property was estimated at £600 a
year, a fortune which, among the fortunes at that
time, probably ranked as a fortune of £2,000 a
year would rank in our days.</p>

<p>William was an infant when the civil war broke
out; and, while he was still in his rudiments, a
Presbyterian hierarchy and a republican government
were established on the ruins of the ancient
church and throne. Old Mr. Wycherley was
attached to the royal cause, and was not disposed
to intrust the education of his heir to the solemn
Puritans who now ruled the universities and the
public schools. Accordingly, the young gentleman
was sent at fifteen to France. He resided some
time in the neighbourhood of the Duke of Montausier,
chief of one of the noblest families of
Touraine. The Duke's wife, a daughter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
house of Rambouillet, was a finished specimen of
those talents and accomplishments for which her
house was celebrated. The young foreigner was
introduced to the splendid circle which surrounded
the duchess, and there he appears to have learned
some good and some evil. In a few years he
returned to this country a fine gentleman and a
Papist. His conversion, it may safely be affirmed,
was the effect not of any strong impression on his
understanding or feelings, but partly of intercourse
with an agreeable society in which the Church of
Rome was the fashion, and partly of that aversion
to Calvinistic austerities which was then almost
universal amongst young Englishmen of parts and
spirit, and which, at one time, seemed likely to
make one half of them Catholics and the other
half Atheists.</p>

<p>But the Restoration came. The universities
were again in loyal hands, and there was reason to
hope that there would be again a national church
fit for a gentleman. Wycherley became a member
of Queen's College, Oxford, and abjured the errors
of the Church of Rome. The somewhat equivocal
glory of turning, for a short time, a good-for-nothing
Papist into a very good-for-nothing Protestant
is ascribed to Bishop Barlow.</p>

<p>Wycherley left Oxford without taking a degree,
and entered at the Temple, where he lived gaily
for some years, observing the humours of the town,
enjoying its pleasures and picking up just as
much law as was necessary to make the character
of a pettifogging attorney or of a litigious client
entertaining in a comedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>From an early age, he had been in the habit of
amusing himself by writing. Some wretched lines
of his on the Restoration are still extant. Had he
devoted himself to the making of verses, he would
have been nearly as far below Tate and Blackmore
as Tate and Blackmore are below Dryden.
His only chance for renown would have been that
he might have occupied a niche in a satire between
Flecknoe and Settle. There was, however, another
kind of composition in which his talents and
acquirements qualified him to succeed; and to
that he judiciously betook himself.</p>

<p>In his old age he used to say that he wrote <i>Love
in a Wood</i> at nineteen, <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>
at twenty-one, the <i>Plain Dealer</i> at twenty-five,
and <i>The Country Wife</i> at one or two and
thirty. We are incredulous, we own, as to the
truth of this story. Nothing that we know of
Wycherley leads us to think him incapable of
sacrificing truth to vanity. And his memory in
the decline of his life played him such strange
tricks that we might question the correctness of
his assertion without throwing any imputation on
his veracity. It is certain that none of his plays
was acted till 1672,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> when he gave <i>Love in a Wood</i>
to the public. It seems improbable that he should
resolve, on so important an occasion as that of
a first appearance before the world, to run his
chance with a feeble piece, written before his talents
were ripe, before his style was formed, before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
had looked abroad into the world; and this when
he had actually in his desk two highly finished
plays, the fruit of his matured powers. When we
look minutely at the pieces themselves, we find in
every part of them reason to suspect the accuracy
of Wycherley's statement. In the first scene of
<i>Love in a Wood</i>, to go no further, we find many
passages which he could not have written when he
was nineteen. There is an allusion to gentlemen's
periwigs, which first came into fashion in 1663; an
allusion to guineas, which were first struck in 1663;
an allusion to the vests which Charles ordered to
be worn at court in 1666; an allusion to the fire
of 1666; and several allusions to political and
ecclesiastical affairs which must be assigned to
times later than the year of the Restoration&mdash;to
times when the government and the city were
opposed to each other, and when the Presbyterian
ministers had been driven from the parish churches
to the conventicles. But it is needless to dwell on
particular expressions. The whole air and spirit
of the piece belong to a period subsequent to that
mentioned by Wycherley. As to <i>The Plain Dealer</i>,
which is said to have been written when he was
twenty-five, it contains one scene unquestionably
written after 1675, several which are later than 1668,
and scarcely a line which can have been composed
before the end of 1666.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the age at which
Wycherley composed his plays, it is certain that
he did not bring them before the public till he was
upwards of thirty. In 1672, <i>Love in a Wood</i> was
acted with more success than it deserved, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
event produced a great change in the fortunes of
the author. The Duchess of Cleveland cast her
eyes upon him and was pleased with his appearance.
This abandoned woman, not content with
her complaisant husband and her royal keeper,
lavished her fondness on a crowd of paramours of
all ranks, from dukes to rope-dancers. In the
time of the Commonwealth she commenced her
career of gallantry, and terminated it under Anne,
by marrying, when a great grandmother, that worthless
fop, Beau Fielding. It is not strange that she
should have regarded Wycherley with favour. His
figure was commanding, his countenance strikingly
handsome, his look and deportment full of grace
and dignity. He had, as Pope said long after,
"the true nobleman look," the look which seems to
indicate superiority, and a not unbecoming consciousness
of superiority. His hair indeed, as he
says in one of his poems, was prematurely grey.
But in that age of periwigs this misfortune was of
little importance.</p>

<p>The Duchess admired him, and proceeded to
make love to him after the fashion of the coarse-minded
and shameless circle to which she belonged.
In the Ring, when the crowd of beauties
and fine gentlemen was thickest, she put her
head out of her coach-window and bawled to
him&mdash;"Sir, you are a rascal; you are a villain;"
and, if she is not belied, she added another phrase
of abuse which we will not quote, but of which we
may say that it might most justly have been
applied to her own children. Wycherley called
on her Grace the next day, and with great humility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
begged to know in what way he had been so unfortunate
as to disoblige her.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thus began an
intimacy from which the poet probably expected
wealth and honours. Nor were such expectations
unreasonable. A handsome young fellow about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
the court, known by the name of Jack Churchill
was, about the same time, so lucky as to become
the object of a short-lived fancy of the Duchess.
She had presented him with £4,500, the price, in
all probability, of some title or some pardon. The
prudent youth had lent the money on high interest
and on landed security; and this judicious investment
was the beginning of the most splendid
private fortune in Europe. Wycherley was not so
lucky. The partiality with which the great lady
regarded him was indeed the talk of the whole
town; and, sixty years later, old men who remembered
those days told Voltaire that she often stole
from the court to her lover's chambers in the
Temple, disguised like a country girl, with a straw
hat on her head, pattens on her feet and a basket
in her hand.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The poet was indeed too happy and proud
to be discreet. He dedicated to the Duchess
the play which had led to their acquaintance,
and in the dedication expressed himself in
terms which could not but confirm the reports
which had gone abroad. But at Whitehall such
an affair was regarded in no serious light. The
lady was not afraid to bring Wycherley to court
and to introduce him to a splendid society, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
which, as far as appears, he had never before
mixed. The easy king, who allowed to his mistresses
the same liberty which he claimed for himself,
was pleased with the conversation and manners
of his new rival. So high did Wycherley stand in
the royal favour that once, when he was confined
by a fever to his lodgings in Bow Street, Charles,
who, with all his faults, was certainly a man of
social and affable disposition, called on him, sat by
his bed, advised him to try a change of air, and
gave him a handsome sum of money to defray the
expenses of a journey.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Buckingham, then Master
of the Horse and one of that infamous ministry
known by the name of the Cabal, had been one
of the Duchess's innumerable paramours. He at
first showed some symptoms of jealousy, but
he soon, after his fashion, veered round from
anger to fondness, and gave Wycherley a commission
in his own regiment and a place in the
royal household.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to Wycherley's memory not
to mention here the only good action, as far as we
know, of his whole life. He is said to have made
great exertions to obtain the patronage of Buckingham
for the illustrious author of <i>Hudibras</i>, who
was now sinking into an obscure grave, neglected
by a nation proud of his genius and by a court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
which he had served too well. His grace consented
to see poor Butler; and an appointment was made.
But unhappily two pretty women passed by; the
volatile Duke ran after them; the opportunity was
lost and could never be regained.</p>

<p>The second Dutch war, the most disgraceful war
in the whole history of England, was now raging.
It was not in that age considered as by any means
necessary that a naval officer should receive a professional
education. Young men of rank, who
were hardly able to keep their feet in a breeze,
served on board the King's ships, sometimes with
commissions and sometimes as volunteers. Mulgrave,
Dorset, Rochester, and many others left the
playhouses and the Mall for hammocks and salt
pork; and, ignorant as they were of the rudiments
of naval service, showed, at least, on the day of
battle, the courage which is seldom wanting in an
English gentleman. All good judges of maritime
affairs complained that, under this system, the
ships were grossly mismanaged, and that the
tarpaulins contracted the vices, without acquiring
the graces, of the court. But on this subject, as
on every other, the government of Charles was
deaf to all remonstrances where the interests or
whims of favourites were concerned. Wycherley
did not choose to be out of the fashion. He
embarked, was present at a battle, and celebrated
it, on his return, in a copy of verses too bad for
the bellman.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>About the same time he brought on the stage
his second piece, <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>.
The biographers say nothing, as far as we remember,
about the fate of this play. There is, however,
reason to believe that, though certainly far superior
to <i>Love in a Wood</i>, it was not equally successful.
It was first tried at the west end of the town, and,
as the poet confessed, "would scarce do there."
It was then performed in Salisbury Court, but, as
it should seem, with no better event. For, in the
prologue to <i>The Country Wife</i>, Wycherley described
himself as "the late so baffled scribbler."</p>

<p>In 1675, <i>The Country Wife</i> was performed with
brilliant success, which, in a literary point of view,
was not wholly unmerited. For, though one of
the most profligate and heartless of human compositions,
it is the elaborate production of a mind,
not indeed rich, original or imaginative, but ingenious,
observant, quick to seize hints, and patient
of the toil of polishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Plain Dealer</i>, equally immoral and equally
well written, appeared in 1677. At first this piece
pleased the people less than the critics; but after
a time its unquestionable merits and the zealous
support of Lord Dorset, whose influence in literary
and fashionable society was unbounded, established
it in the public favour.</p>

<p>The fortune of Wycherley was now in the
zenith and began to decline. A long life was
still before him. But it was destined to be filled
with nothing but shame and wretchedness, domestic
dissensions, literary failures and pecuniary embarrassments.</p>

<p>The King, who was looking about for an accomplished
man to conduct the education of his natural
son, the young Duke of Richmond, at length fixed
on Wycherley. The poet, exulting in his good
luck, went down to amuse himself at Tunbridge,
looked into a bookseller's shop on the Pantiles,
and, to his great delight, heard a handsome woman
ask for <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, which had just been
published. He made acquaintance with the lady,
who proved to be the Countess of Drogheda, a
gay young widow with an ample jointure. She
was charmed with his person and his wit, and
after a short flirtation, agreed to become his wife.
Wycherley seems to have been apprehensive that
this connection might not suit well with the King's
plans respecting the Duke of Richmond. He
accordingly prevailed on the lady to consent to a
private marriage. All came out. Charles thought
the conduct of Wycherley both disrespectful and
disingenuous. Other causes probably assisted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
alienate the sovereign from the subject who had
lately been so highly favoured. Buckingham was
now in opposition and had been committed to the
Tower; not, as Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes, on a
charge of treason, but by an order of the House
of Lords for some expressions which he had used
in debate. Wycherley wrote some bad lines in
praise of his imprisoned patron, which, if they
came to the knowledge of the King, would certainly
have made his majesty very angry. The favour
of the court was completely withdrawn from the
poet. An amiable woman with a large fortune
might indeed have been an ample compensation
for the loss. But Lady Drogheda was ill-tempered,
imperious and extravagantly jealous. She had
herself been a maid of honour at Whitehall. She
well knew in what estimation conjugal fidelity was
held among the fine gentlemen there, and watched
her town husband as assiduously as Mr. Pinchwife
watched his country wife. The unfortunate wit was,
indeed, allowed to meet his friends at a tavern
opposite to his own house. But on such occasions
the windows were always open, in order that her
ladyship, who was posted on the other side of the
street, might be satisfied that no woman was of
the party.</p>

<p>The death of Lady Drogheda released the poet
from this distress; but a series of disasters in rapid
succession broke down his health, his spirits and
his fortune. His wife meant to leave him a good
property and left him only a lawsuit. His father
could not or would not assist him. He was at
length thrown into the Fleet, and languished there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
during seven years, utterly forgotten, as it should
seem, by the gay and lively circle of which he had
been a distinguished ornament. In the extremity
of his distress, he implored the publisher who had
been enriched by the sale of his works to lend him
twenty pounds, and was refused. His comedies,
however, still kept the stage and drew great
audiences, which troubled themselves little about
the situation of the author. At length, James the
Second, who had now succeeded to the throne,
happened to go to the theatre on an evening when
<i>The Plain Dealer</i> was acted. He was pleased
with the performance, and touched by the fate of
the writer, whom he probably remembered as one
of the gayest and handsomest of his brother's
courtiers. The King determined to pay Wycherley's
debts and to settle on the unfortunate poet
a pension of £200 a-year. This munificence on
the part of a prince who was little in the habit of
rewarding literary merit, and whose whole soul
was devoted to the interests of his Church, raises
in us a surmise which Mr. Leigh Hunt will, we
fear, pronounce very uncharitable. We cannot help
suspecting that it was at this time that Wycherley
returned to the communion of the Church of
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> That he did return to the communion of
the Church of Rome is certain. The date of his
reconversion, as far as we know, has never been
mentioned by any biographer. We believe that,
if we place it at this time, we do no injustice to
the character either of Wycherley or James.</p>

<p>Not long after, old Mr. Wycherley died; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
his son, now past the middle of life, came to the
family estate. Still, however, he was not at his
ease. His embarrassments were great; his property
was strictly tied up; and he was on very
bad terms with the heir-at-law. He appears to
have led, during a long course of years, that most
wretched life, the life of an old boy about town.
Expensive tastes with little money and licentious
appetites with declining vigour, were the just
penance for his early irregularities. A severe
illness had produced a singular effect on his intellect.
His memory played him pranks stranger
than almost any that are to be found in the history
of that strange faculty.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It seemed to be at once
preternaturally strong and preternaturally weak.
If a book was read to him before he went to bed,
he would wake the next morning with his mind
full of the thoughts and expressions which he had
heard over night; and he would write them down,
without in the least suspecting that they were not
his own. In his verses the same ideas, and even
the same words, came over and over again several
times in a short composition. His fine person
bore the marks of age, sickness and sorrow; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
he mourned for his departed beauty with an
effeminate regret. He could not look without a
sigh at the portrait which Lely had painted of him
when he was only twenty-eight, and often murmured,
<i>Quantum mutatus ab illo</i>.</p>

<p>He was still nervously anxious about his literary
reputation, and, not content with the fame
which he still possessed as a dramatist, was
determined to be renowned as a satirist and an
amatory poet. In 1704, after twenty-seven years
of silence, he again appeared as an author. He
put forth a large folio of miscellaneous verses,
which, we believe, has never been reprinted.
Some of these pieces had probably circulated
through the town in manuscript. For, before
the volume appeared, the critics at the coffee-houses
very confidently predicted that it would
be utterly worthless, and were in consequence
bitterly reviled by the poet in an ill-written foolish
and egotistical preface. The book amply vindicated
the most unfavourable prophecies that
had been hazarded. The style and versification
are beneath criticism; the morals are those of
Rochester. For Rochester, indeed, there was
some excuse. When his offences against decorum
were committed, he was a very young
man, misled by a prevailing fashion. Wycherley
was sixty-four. He had long outlived the times
when libertinism was regarded as essential to the
character of a wit and a gentleman. Most of the
rising poets, Addison, for example, John Philips
and Rowe, were studious of decency. We can
hardly conceive anything more miserable than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
figure which the ribald old man makes in the midst
of so many sober and well-conducted youths.</p>

<p>In the very year in which this bulky volume of
obscene doggerel was published, Wycherley formed
an acquaintance of a very singular kind. A little,
pale, crooked, sickly, bright-eyed urchin, just turned
of sixteen, had written some copies of verses in
which discerning judges could detect the promise
of future eminence. There was, indeed, as yet
nothing very striking or original in the conceptions
of the young poet. But he was already skilled in
the art of metrical composition. His diction and
his music were not those of the great old masters;
but that which his ablest contemporaries were
labouring to do he already did best. His style
was not richly poetical; but it was always neat,
compact and pointed. His verse wanted variety of
pause, of swell and of cadence, but never grated
harshly on the ear or disappointed it by a feeble
close. The youth was already free of the company
of wits, and was greatly elated at being introduced
to the author of <i>The Plain Dealer</i> and <i>The Country
Wife</i>.</p>

<p>It is curious to trace the history of the intercourse
which took place between Wycherley and
Pope&mdash;between the representative of the age that
was going out and the representative of the age that
was coming in&mdash;between the friend of
Rochester and Buckingham and the friend of
Lyttleton and Mansfield. At first the boy was enchanted
by the kindness and condescension of his
new friend, haunted his door and followed him
about like a spaniel from coffee-house to coffee-house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
Letters full of affection, humility and fulsome
flattery were interchanged between the
friends. But the first ardour of affection could not
last. Pope, though at no time scrupulously delicate
in his writings or fastidious as to the morals of
his associates, was shocked<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> by the indecency of a
rake who, at seventy, was still the representative of
the monstrous profligacy of the Restoration. As
the youth grew older, as his mind expanded and
his fame rose, he appreciated both himself and
Wycherley more correctly. He felt a well-founded
contempt for the old gentleman's verses, and was
at no great pains to conceal his opinion. Wycherley,
on the other hand, though blinded by self-love
to the imperfections of what he called his poetry,
could not but see that there was an immense
difference between his young companion's rhymes
and his own. He was divided between two feelings.
He wished to have the assistance of so
skilful a hand to polish his lines; and yet he
shrank from the humiliation of being beholden for
literary assistance to a lad who might have been
his grandson.</p>

<p>Pope was willing to give assistance, but was by
no means disposed to give assistance and flattery
too. He took the trouble to retouch whole
reams of feeble, stumbling verses, and inserted
many vigorous lines, which the least skilful
reader will distinguish in an instant. But he
thought that by these services he acquired a right
to express himself in terms which would not, under
ordinary circumstances, become one who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
addressing a man of four times his age. In one
letter, he tells Wycherley that "the worst pieces
are such as, to render them very good, would
require almost the entire new writing of them."
In another, he gives the following account of his
corrections: "Though the whole be as short
again as at first, there is not one thought omitted
but what is a repetition of something in your first
volume or in this very paper; and the versification
throughout is, I believe, such as nobody can be
shocked at. The repeated permission you give me
of dealing freely with you, will, I hope, excuse
what I have done; for, if I have not spared you
when I thought severity would do you a kindness, I
have not mangled you when I thought there was
no absolute need of amputation."</p>

<p>Wycherley continued to return thanks for all
this hacking and hewing, which was, indeed, of
inestimable service to his composition. But by
degrees his thanks began to sound very like
reproaches. In private, he is said to have described
Pope as a person who could not cut out a suit,
but who had some skill in turning old coats.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
In his letters to Pope, while he acknowledged
that the versification of the poems had been
greatly improved, he spoke of the whole art of
versification with scorn, and sneered at those
who preferred sound to sense. Pope revenged
himself for this outbreak of spleen by return
of post. He had in his hands a volume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
Wycherley's rhymes, and he wrote to say that this
volume was so full of faults that he could not
correct it without completely defacing the manuscript.
"I am," he said, "equally afraid of sparing
you and of offending you by too impudent a
correction." This was more than flesh and blood
could bear. Wycherley reclaimed his papers in a
letter in which resentment shows itself plainly
through the thin disguise of civility. Pope, glad to
be rid of a troublesome and inglorious task, sent
back the deposit, and, by way of a parting courtesy,
advised the old man to turn his poetry into prose,
and assured him that the public would like his
thoughts much better without his versification.
Thus ended this memorable correspondence.</p>

<p>Wycherley lived some years after the termination
of the strange friendship which we have described.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The last scene of his life was, perhaps, the most
scandalous. Ten days before his death, at seventy-five,
he married a young girl, merely in order to
injure his nephew, an act which proves that neither
years nor adversity, nor what he called his
philosophy, nor either of the religions which he
had at different times professed, had taught him
the rudiments of morality.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He died in December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
1715, and lies in the vault under the church of St.
Paul in Covent Garden.</p>

<p>His bride soon after married a Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
Shrimpton, who thus became possessed of a
large collection of manuscripts. These were
sold to a bookseller. They were so full of
erasures and interlineations that no printer could
decipher them. It was necessary to call in the aid
of a professed critic; and Theobald, the editor of
Shakespeare and the hero of the first <i>Dunciad</i>, was
employed to ascertain the true reading. In this
way, a volume of miscellanies in verse and prose
was got up for the market. The collection derives
all its value from the traces of Pope's hand, which
are everywhere discernible.</p>

<p>Of the moral character of Wycherley it can
hardly be necessary for us to say more. His fame
as a writer rests wholly on his comedies, and
chiefly on the last two. Even as a comic writer,
he was neither of the best school, nor highest in his
school. He was in truth a worst Congreve. His
chief merit, like Congreve's, lies in the style of his
dialogue. But the wit which lights up <i>The Plain
Dealer</i> and <i>The Country Wife</i> is pale and flickering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
when compared with the gorgeous blaze which
dazzles us almost to blindness in <i>Love for Love</i>
and <i>The Way of the World</i>. Like Congreve, and,
indeed, even more than Congreve, Wycherley is
ready to sacrifice dramatic propriety to the liveliness
of his dialogue. The poet speaks out of the
mouths of all his dunces and coxcombs, and makes
them describe themselves with a good sense and
acuteness which puts them on a level with the wits
and heroes. We will give two instances, the first
which occur to us, from <i>The Country Wife</i>. There
are in the world fools who find the society of old
friends insipid and who are always running after
new companions. Such a character is a fair subject
for comedy. But nothing can be more absurd
than to introduce a man of this sort saying to his
comrade, "I can deny you nothing: for though I
have known thee a great while, never go if I do not
love thee as well as a new acquaintance." That
town-wits again, have always been rather a heartless
class, is true. But none of them, we will
answer for it, ever said to a young lady to whom
he was making love, "We wits rail and make love
often but to show our parts: as we have no affections,
so we have no malice."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Wycherley's plays are said to have been the
produce of long and patient labour. The epithet
of "slow" was early given to him by Rochester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
and was frequently repeated.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In truth, his mind,
unless we are greatly mistaken, was naturally a
very meagre soil, and was forced only by great
labour and outlay to bear fruit which, after all, was
not of the highest flavour. He has scarcely more
claim to originality than Terence. It is not too
much to say that there is hardly anything of the
least value in his plays of which the hint is not to
be found elsewhere. The best scenes in <i>The
Gentleman Dancing-Master</i> were suggested by
Calderon's <i>Maestro de Danzar</i>, not by any means
one of the happiest comedies of the great Castilian
poet. <i>The Country Wife</i> is borrowed from the
<i>Ecole des Maris</i> and the <i>Ecole des Femmes</i>. The
groundwork of <i>The Plain Dealer</i> is taken from the
<i>Misanthrope</i> of Molière. One whole scene is
almost translated from the <i>Critique de l'Ecole des
Femmes.</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Fidelia is Shakespeare's Viola stolen,
and marred in the stealing: and the widow Blackacre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
beyond comparison Wycherley's best comic
character, is the Countess in Racine's <i>Plaideurs</i>,
talking the jargon of English instead of that of
French chicane.</p>

<p>The only thing original about Wycherley, the
only thing which he could furnish from his own
mind in inexhaustible abundance, was profligacy.
It is curious to observe how everything that he
touched, however pure and noble, took in an instant
the colour of his own mind. Compare the <i>Ecole
des Femmes</i> with <i>The Country Wife</i>. Agnes is a
simple and amiable girl, whose heart is indeed full
of love, but of love sanctioned by honour, morality
and religion. Her natural talents are great. They
have been hidden and, as it might appear, destroyed
by an education elaborately bad. But they are
called forth into full energy by a virtuous passion.
Her lover, while he adores her beauty, is too honest
a man to abuse the confiding tenderness of a
creature so charming and inexperienced. Wycherley
takes this plot into his hands; and forthwith
this sweet and graceful courtship becomes a licentious
intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental
kind, between an impudent London rake and
the idiot wife of a country squire. We will not
go into details. In truth, Wycherley's indecency
is protected against the critics as a skunk
is protected against the hunters. It is safe,
because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome
even to approach.</p>

<p>It is the same with <i>The Plain Dealer</i>. How
careful has Shakespeare been in <i>Twelfth Night</i> to
preserve the dignity and delicacy of Viola under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
her disguise! Even when wearing a page's doublet
and hose, she is never mixed up with any transaction
which the most fastidious mind could regard
as leaving a stain on her. She is employed by the
Duke on an embassy of love to Olivia, but on an
embassy of the most honourable kind. Wycherley
borrows Viola&mdash;and Viola forthwith becomes a
pander of the basest sort. But the character of
Manly is the best illustration of our meaning.
Molière exhibited in his misanthrope a pure and
noble mind which had been sorely vexed by the
sight of perfidy and malevolence disguised under
the forms of politeness. As every extreme naturally
generates its contrary, Alceste adopts a standard
of good and evil directly opposed to that of the
society which surrounds him. Courtesy seems to
him a vice; and those stern virtues which are
neglected by the fops and coquettes of Paris
become too exclusively the objects of his veneration.
He is often to blame; he is often ridiculous:
but he is always a good man; and the feeling
which he inspires is regret that a person so estimable
should be so unamiable. Wycherley borrowed
Alceste, and turned him&mdash;we quote the words of
so lenient a critic as Mr. Leigh Hunt&mdash;into "a
ferocious sensualist, who believed himself as great
a rascal as he thought everybody else." The
surliness of Molière's hero is copied and caricatured.
But the most nauseous libertinism and the most
dastardly fraud are substituted for the purity and
integrity of the original. And, to make the whole
complete, Wycherley does not seem to have been
aware that he was not drawing the portrait of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
eminently honest man. So depraved was his moral
taste, that, while he firmly believed that he was
producing a picture of virtue too exalted for the
commerce of this world, he was really delineating
the greatest rascal that is to be found even in his
own writings.</p>

<p>Wycherley informed Pope that he wrote
his first comedy. <i>Love in a Wood</i>, at the
age of nineteen&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the year 1659-60.
If this statement be accurate, the play must
have undergone very considerable alterations
previous to its production on the
stage; for not only do we discover in it occasional allusions
to events of later years, but the whole piece displays an
intimate acquaintance with life in the metropolis scarcely
commensurate with the opportunities of a youth who, from
the age of fifteen, when he was sent into France, to that of
twenty, when he became a student at Oxford, can have
passed but a few weeks, at the most, in London. From the
<i>Biographia Britannica</i> we learn that Wycherley returned
from France shortly before the Restoration; from Wood's
<i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i> that he became a fellow commoner of
Queen's College, Oxford, also "a little before the Restoration
of Charles II., but wore not a gown, only lived in the
provost's lodgings," and "was entered in the public library
(the Bodleian) under the title of philosophiæ studiosus in
July, 1660." In the <i>Fasti Oxonienses</i>, however, the following
entry occurs under the year 1660: "In the month of July
this year Will. Wicherley became sojourner in Oxon for the
sake of the public library." We are at liberty, therefore, to
conclude that between the date of his return to England and
the following July, part, at least, of our author's time may
have been spent in London, where he may possibly have
composed the first draught of his comedy, and where, at all
events, his quick observation would furnish him with
material sufficient for a first draught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1672 has been universally determined as that of
the first performance of <i>Love in a Wood</i>; I believe, nevertheless,
incorrectly. We are as certain as we can be, in the
absence of direct evidence, that Wycherley's second play,
<i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>, was first brought upon the
stage in 1671.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Now there is little doubt that <i>The Gentleman
Dancing-Master</i> had been preceded by <i>Love in a Wood</i>, for
not only do the authorities generally concur in assigning
an earlier date to the production of the latter play, but
Wycherley, in dedicating it to the Duchess of Cleveland,
refers pointedly to himself as a "new author." Further in
the dedication we find that her Grace had honoured the poet
by going to see his comedy twice together, <i>during Lent</i>, and
had been pleased, thereupon, to command from him a copy
of the play, with which he takes occasion to offer the
dedicatory epistle. These were not the days of long runs,
even for the most successful dramas, nor are we likely to err
in assuming that the Duchess was present at an early
performance of the piece which she distinguished with her
favour; or that Wycherley prefixed her title to a comedy
newly brought upon the stage, rather than to one which had
already been for some time the property of the public, and
which had been revived, as must then have been the case,
before the Duchess had seen it. Note, also, that the
dedication is addressed to the Duchess of Cleveland by that
title. In Lent, 1670, Barbara Palmer was Countess of
Castlemaine: she was created Duchess of Cleveland on the
3rd of August in the same year. Considering then that the
piece was certainly performed during Lent, that it cannot
have been produced later than 1671, and that the Duchess
to whom it was inscribed enjoyed not that title until the
autumn of 1670, we may conclude, with tolerable security,
that the first performance of <i>Love in a Wood</i> took place
some time during the spring of 1671.</p>

<p>Genest indeed, supposes it to have been brought out by the
King's Company after their removal to the theatre in Lincoln's
Inn Fields.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Their own house in Drury Lane having
been destroyed by fire in January, 1672, they opened, on
the 26th of February following, the Lincoln's Inn Fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Theatre, which had been untenanted since the migration of
the Duke's Company to Dorset Gardens in the preceding
November, with a representation of Beaumont and Fletcher's
<i>Wit without Money</i>. This was succeeded, in order, by
<i>Arviragus and Philicia</i> and Dryden's <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>,
after which, Genest thinks, <i>Love in a Wood</i> was produced.
But, on this supposition, the first performance of <i>Love in a
Wood</i> must have taken place later than that of <i>The Gentleman
Dancing-Master</i>, and in that case it seems hardly
probable that Wycherley should describe himself as a <i>new</i>
author in the dedication to the former play. Moreover, the
prologue to Wycherley's third comedy, <i>The Country Wife</i>,
contains a distinct allusion to the recent ill-fortune of <i>The
Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>, which we can scarcely suppose
the author would have thus referred to, had a successful
play of his been produced in the interval, and that by the
same company which brought forward <i>The Country Wife</i>.
In fact, the only argument which I can conceive it possible
to adduce in support of Genest must be based upon a
conjecture that not only <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>,
but <i>Love in a Wood</i> also, had failed to win the favour of the
public, and that it is the latter play to which allusion is
intended in the prologue to <i>The Country Wife</i>. That <i>The
Gentleman Dancing-Master</i> proved a failure is certain; that
<i>Love in a Wood</i> succeeded, we have no direct evidence, but
of circumstantial sufficient, I think, to prove the point. The
general assumption in its favour we may pass; but the
whole tone of the dedication, though it afford us no information,
in so many words, as to the fate of the piece, forbids us
to believe that it can have been indited by the "baffled
scribbler" of a condemned comedy. Indeed, had the piece
thus failed, it is quite inconceivable that Wycherley would
have had the temerity to offer it to the Duchess; he would
rather have sent it into the world silently, and without the
flourish of a dedication, as was actually the case with <i>The
Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>. Dennis, moreover, declares
expressly that <i>Love in a Wood</i> brought its author acquainted
with the wits of the Court, and we may question whether the
reputation of an unprosperous playwright would have proved
the surest passport to their intimacy.</p>

<p>The reasons for rejecting the date of 1672 thus recounted,
there remains but to notice one inconsiderable particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
which, could we allow it consequence, would tend to determine
the production of <i>Love in a Wood</i> at a yet earlier
date than that to which I have assigned it. In a conversation
with the Duchess, immediately after her visit to his
play, Wycherley, as reported by Dennis, continually addresses
her Grace by the title of "your Ladyship." I doubt not,
however, that this is a mere slip on the part of Dennis, nor
can we easily imagine that Wycherley deferred, until the
autumn, the presentation of his play to a lady who had
"commanded" it of him, with such distinguishing marks of
favour, in the preceding spring.</p>

<p><i>Love in a Wood</i>, then, was produced by the King's company,
during the spring of 1671, at the Theatre Royal, in
Drury Lane. Some of the first actors of the day took part
in the performances. Hart, who in tragedy yielded the
palm to Betterton alone, appeared as Ranger, Mohun as
Dapperwit; Lacy the comedian, soon afterwards "creator"
of Bayes, as Alderman Gripe; and Kinaston, who in his
youth, before women trod the boards, had been famous in
female parts, now, changing sides, enacted the jealous lover,
Valentine. The rôle of Lady Flippant was taken by an
actress well known to us from the pages of Pepys&mdash;his
favourite Mrs. Knipp, "a merry jade!"</p>

<p>Upon the whole this play must be owned inferior to
Wycherley's other dramas. It is excelled in unity of action
by <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>, in richness of humour
by <i>The Country Wife</i>, in strength of satire by <i>The Plain
Dealer</i>. Nevertheless, it is a highly diverting, witty comedy,
and strikingly superior to most of the new plays which, since
the Restoration, had preceded it upon the stage. Some
critics would have us believe that Wycherley derived the
suggestion of this play from Sir Charles Sedley's comedy of
<i>The Mulberry Garden</i>. It is difficult to understand upon
what grounds this assertion is based. In the first place,
although <i>The Mulberry Garden</i> was produced on the stage
in 1668, nearly three years earlier than <i>Love in a Wood</i>, it
is exceedingly doubtful if it were earlier written. Indeed, if
Wycherley may be credited as to the year in which his own
play was composed, the question of priority is easily settled,
for <i>The Mulberry Garden</i> cannot have been written until
after the Restoration, as its dénouement turns upon the
proclamation of the King by General Monk. Moreover, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
is hardly possible that Wycherley should have known anything
of Sedley's play before its public representation, as he
seems not to have been acquainted with Sedley himself until
after the production of his own drama, so that our acceptance
of the theory that he borrowed from Sedley the hint of
<i>Love in a Wood</i> would involve the unwarrantable conclusion
that he also, in conversation with Pope, antedated its composition
by at least eight years. But further, the only
considerable point of resemblance between the two plays
appears to be that while in Wycherley's part of the action
takes place in St. James's Park, in Sedley's one of the scenes
is laid in the Mulberry Garden, which was certainly very
near to St. James's Park, being, in fact, situated at its
western extremity. If the reader choose to consider this
remarkable coincidence sufficient to justify a charge of
plagiarism against Wycherley, I have nothing more to urge
in his defence.</p>

<p><i>Love in a Wood</i> was registered at Stationers' Hall on the
6th of October, 1671, and was published in the following
year.</p>

<h3>TO HER GRACE<br />
THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND.</h3>


<p>Madam,</p>

<p>All authors whatever in their dedication
are poets; but I am now to write to a
lady who stands as little in need of
flattery, as her beauty of art; otherwise I
should prove as ill a poet to her in my
dedication, as to my reader in my play. I
can do your Grace no honour, nor make you more admirers
than you have already; yet I can do myself the honour to
let the world know I am the greatest you have. You will
pardon me, Madam, for you know it is very hard for a new
author, and poet too, to govern his ambition: for poets, let
them pass in the world ever so much for modest, honest
men, but begin praise to others which concludes in themselves;
and are like rooks, who lend people money but to
win it back again, and so leave them in debt to 'em for
nothing; they offer laurel and incense to their heroes, but
wear it themselves, and perfume themselves. This is true,
Madam, upon the honest word of an author who never yet
writ dedication. Yet though I cannot lie like them, I am as
vain as they; and cannot but publicly give your Grace my
humble acknowledgments for the favours I have received
from you:&mdash;this, I say, is the poet's gratitude, which, in
plain English, is only pride and ambition; and that the
world might know your Grace did me the honour to see my
play twice together. Yet, perhaps, my enviers of your favour
will suggest 'twas in Lent, and therefore for your mortification.
Then, as a jealous author, I am concerned not to
have your Grace's favours lessened, or rather my reputation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and to let them know, you were pleased, after that, to command
a copy from me of this play;&mdash;the only way, without
beauty and wit, to win a poor poet's heart.</p>

<p>'Tis a sign your Grace understands nothing better than
obliging all the world after the best and most proper manner.
But, Madam, to be obliging to that excess as you are (pardon
me, if I tell you, out of my extreme concern and service for
your Grace) is a dangerous quality, and may be very incommode
to you; for civility makes poets as troublesome, as
charity makes beggars; and your Grace will be hereafter as
much pestered with such scurvy offerings as this, poems,
panegyrics, and the like, as you are now with petitions: and,
Madam, take it from me, no man with papers in 's hand is
more dreadful than a poet; no, not a lawyer with his declarations.
Your Grace sure did not well consider what ye did,
in sending for my play: you little thought I would have had
the confidence to send you a dedication too. But, Madam,
you find I am as unreasonable, and have as little conscience,
as if I had driven the poetic trade longer than I have, and
ne'er consider you had enough of the play. But (having
suffered now so severely) I beseech your Grace, have a care
for the future; take my counsel, and be (if you can possible)
as proud and ill-natured as other people of quality, since
your quiet is so much concerned, and since you have more
reason than any to value yourself:&mdash;for you have that perfection
of beauty (without thinking it so) which others of
your sex but think they have; that generosity in your actions
which others of your quality have only in their promises;
that spirit, wit and judgment, and all other qualifications
which fit heroes to command, and would make any but your
Grace proud. I begin now, elevated by my subject, to write
with the emotion and fury of a poet, yet the integrity of an
historian; and I could never be weary&mdash;nay, sure this were
my only way to make my readers never weary too, though
they were a more impatient generation of people than they
are. In fine, speaking thus of your Grace, I should please
all the world but you; therefore I must once observe and
obey you against my will, and say no more, than that I am,</p>

<p>Madam,</p>

<p>Your Grace's most obliged, and most humble servant,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To greet you ere his execution.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not having fear of critic 'fore his eyes,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He e'en is come to suffer here to-day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For counterfeiting (as you judge) a play,</span><br />

<h2><i>LOVE IN A WOOD;<br />
OR,<br />
ST. JAMES'S PARK.</i></h2>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gripe's</span> <i>House, in the evening.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Flip.</i> Not a husband to be had
for money!&mdash;Come, come, I might
have been a better housewife for myself,
as the world goes now, if I had
dealt for an heir with his guardian,
uncle, or mother-in-law; and you are
no better than a chouse, a cheat.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I a cheat, madam!</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I am out of my money, and patience too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Do not run out of your patience, whatever
you do:&mdash;'tis a necessary virtue for a widow without a
jointure, in truly.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Vile woman! though my fortune be something
wasted, my person's in good repair. If I had not
depended on you, I had had a husband before this time.
When I gave you the last five pounds, did you not promise
I should be married by Christmas?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> And I had kept my promise if you had co-operated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Co-operated! what should I have done? 'Tis
well known no woman breathing could use more industry
to get her a husband than I have. Has not my
husband's 'scutcheon walked as much ground as the
citizens' signs since the Fire?&mdash;that no quarter of the
town might be ignorant of the widow Flippant.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> 'Tis well known, madam, indeed.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Have I not owned myself (against my stomach)
the relict of a citizen, to credit my fortune?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> 'Tis confessed, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Have I not constantly kept Covent-Garden
church, St. Martin's, the playhouses, Hyde Park, Mulberry
garden,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and all the other public marts where
widows and maids are exposed?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Far be it from me to think you have an
aversion to a husband. But why, madam, have you
refused so many good offers?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Good offers, Mrs. Joyner! I'll be sworn I
never had an offer since my late husband's.&mdash;If I had an
offer, Mrs. Joyner!&mdash;there's the thing, Mrs. Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Then your frequent and public detestation
of marriage is thought real; and if you have had no
offer, there's the thing, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I cannot deny but I always rail against
marriage;&mdash;which is the widow's way to it certainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> 'Tis the desperate way of the desperate
widows, in truly.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Would you have us as tractable as the wenches
that eat oatmeal, and fooled like them too?</p>

<p><i>Mrs Joyn.</i> If nobody were wiser than I, I should think,
since the widow wants the natural allurement which the
virgin has, you ought to give men all other encouragements,
in truly.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Therefore, on the contrary, because the
widow's fortune (whether supposed or real) is her chiefest
bait, the more chary she seems of it, and the more she
withdraws it, the more eagerly the busy gaping fry will
bite. With us widows, husbands are got like bishoprics,
by saying "No:" and I tell you, a young heir is as shy
of a widow as of a rook, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I can allege nothing against your practice&mdash;but
your ill success; and indeed you must use another
method with Sir Simon Addleplot.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will he be at your house at the hour?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> He'll be there by ten:&mdash;'tis now nine. I'll
warrant you he will not fail.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I'll warrant you then I will not fail:&mdash;for 'tis
more than time I were sped.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Mr. Dapperwit has not been too busy with
you, I hope?&mdash;Your experience has taught you to prevent
a mischance.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> No, no, my mischance (as you call it) is
greater than that. I have but three months to reckon,
ere I lie down with my port and equipage, and must be
delivered of a woman, a footman, and a coachman:&mdash;for
my coach must down, unless I can get Sir Simon to
draw with me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> He will pair with you exactly if you knew
all. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Ah, Mrs. Joyner, nothing grieves me like the
putting down my coach! For the fine clothes, the fine
lodgings,&mdash;let 'em go; for a lodging is as unnecessary a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
thing to a widow that has a coach, as a hat to a man
that has a good peruke. For, as you see about town,
she is most properly at home in her coach:&mdash;she eats,
and drinks, and sleeps in her coach; and for her visits,
she receives them in the playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Ay, ay, let the men keep lodgings, as you
say, madam, if they will.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter behind, at one door,</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span> <i>and</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span>,
<i>the latter in the dress of a</i> Clerk; <i>at the other,</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Do you think if things had been with me as
they have been, I would ever have housed with this
counter-fashion brother of mine, (who hates a vest as
much as a surplice,) to have my patches assaulted every
day at dinner, my freedom censured, and my visitants shut
out of doors?&mdash;Poor Mr. Dapperwit cannot be admitted.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> He knows him too well to keep his acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> He is a censorious rigid fop, and knows
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> So, so! [<i>Behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Is he here?&mdash;[<i>To</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.]
Nay, with your pardon, madam, I must contradict you
there. He is a prying commonwealth's-man, an implacable
magistrate, a sturdy pillar of his cause, and&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Gripe</span>] But, oh me, is your worship so near then?
if I had thought you heard me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Why, why, Mrs. Joyner, I have said as much
of myself ere now; and without vanity, I profess.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I know your virtue is proof against vainglory;
but the truth to your face looks like flattery in
your worship's servant.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, no; say what you will of me in that kind,
far be it from me to suspect you of flattery.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> In truly, your worship knows yourself, and
knows me, for I am none of those&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now they are in&mdash;Mrs. Joyner, I'll
go before to your house, you'll be sure to come after me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Immediately.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.]
But as I was saying, I am none of those&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, Mrs. Joyner, you cannot sew pillows under
folks' elbows; you cannot hold a candle to the devil;
you cannot tickle a trout to take him; you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Lord, how well you do know me indeed!&mdash;and
you shall see I know your worship as well. You
cannot backslide from your principles; you cannot be
terrified by the laws; nor bribed to allegiance by office or
preferment; you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Hold, hold, my praise must not interrupt
yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> With your worship's pardon, in truly, I
must on.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I am full of your praise, and it will run over.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, sweet sir, you are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Nay, sweet Mrs. Joyner, you are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, good your worship, you are&mdash;[<i>Stops
her mouth with his handkerchief.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I say you are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I must not be rude with your worship.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You are a nursing mother to the saints;
through you they gather together; through you they
fructify and increase; and through you the child cries
from out of the hand-basket.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Through you virgins are married, or provided
for as well; through you the reprobate's wife is
made a saint; and through you the widow is not disconsolate,
nor misses her husband.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Through you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Indeed you will put me to the blush.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Blushes are badges of imperfection:&mdash;saints
have no shame. You are&mdash;are the flower of matrons,
Mrs. Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You are the pink of courteous aldermen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You are the muffler of secrecy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You are the head-band of justice.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Thank you, sweet Mrs. Joyner: do you think
so indeed? You are&mdash;you are the bonfire of devotion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You are the bellows of zeal.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You are the cupboard of charity.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You are the fob of liberality.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You are the rivet of sanctified love or wedlock.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You are the picklock and dark-lantern of
policy; and, in a word, a conventicle of virtues.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Your servant, your servant, sweet Mrs. Joyner!
you have stopped my mouth.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Your servant, your servant, sweet alderman!
I have nothing to say.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> The half pullet will be cold, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Mrs. Joyner, you shall sup with me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Indeed I am engaged to supper with some
of your man's friends; and I came on purpose to get
leave for him too.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I cannot deny you anything. But I have forgot
to tell you what a kind of fellow my sister's Dapperwit
is: before a full table of the coffee-house sages, he had
the impudence to hold an argument against me in the
defence of vests and protections; and therefore I forbid
him my house; besides, when he came I was forced to
lock up my daughter for fear of him, nay, I think the
poor child herself was afraid of him.&mdash;Come hither, child,
were you not afraid of Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Yes indeed, sir, he is a terrible man.&mdash;Yet I
durst meet with him in a piazza at midnight. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> He shall never come into my doors again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Shall Mr. Dapperwit never come hither
again then?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, child.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I am afraid he will.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I warrant thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I warrant you then I'll go to him.&mdash;I
am glad of that, for I hate him as much as a bishop.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Thou art no child of mine, if thou dost not
hate bishops and wits.&mdash;Well, Mrs. Joyner, I'll keep you
no longer. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Addleplot</span>.] Jonas, wait on Mrs.
Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Good night to your worship.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> But stay, stay, Mrs. Joyner: have you spoken
with the widow Crossbite about her little daughter, as I
desired?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I will to-morrow early; it shall be the first
thing I'll do after my prayers.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> If Dapperwit should contaminate her!&mdash;I cannot
rest till I have redeemed her from the jaws of that
lion.&mdash;Good night.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Good gentleman.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Mrs. Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What's the matter, Sir Simon?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;let us make haste to your
house, or I shall burst, faith and troth, to see what fools
you and I make of these people.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I will not rob you of any of the credit;
I am but a feeble instrument, you are an engineer.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Remember what you say now when things
succeed, and do not tell me then,&mdash;I must thank your
wit for all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> No, in truly, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, I am sure Dapperwit and I have been
partners in many an intrigue, and he uses to serve
me so.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> He is an ill man to intrigue with, as you
call it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Ay, so are all your wits; a pox! if a man's
understanding be not so public as theirs, he cannot do a
wise action but they go away with the honour of it, if he
be of their acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Why do you keep such acquaintance then?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> There is a proverb, Mrs. Joyner, "You may
know him by his company."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> No, no, to be thought a man of parts, you
must always keep company with a man of less wit than
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> That's the hardest thing in the world for me
to do, faith and troth.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What, to find a man of less wit than yourself?
Pardon my raillery, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> No, no, I cannot keep company with a fool:&mdash;I
wonder how men of parts can do't, there's something
in't.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> If you could, all your wise actions would
be your own, and your money would be your own too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, faith and troth, that's true; for your
wits are plaguily given to borrow. They'll borrow of
their wench, coachman, or linkboy, their hire, Mrs.
Joyner; Dapperwit has that trick with a vengeance.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Why will you keep company with him
then, I say? for, to be plain with you, you have followed
him so long, that you are thought but his cully;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> for
every wit has his cully, as every squire his led captain.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I his cully, I his cully, Mrs. Joyner! Lord,
that I should be thought a cully to any wit breathing!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, do not take it so to heart, for the
best wits of the town are but cullies themselves.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> To whom, to whom, to whom, Mrs. Joyner?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> To sempstresses and bawds.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> To your knowledge, Mrs. Joyner.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
There I was with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> To tailors and vintners, but especially to
the French houses.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> But Dapperwit is a cully to none of them;
for he ticks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I care not, but I wish you were a cully to
none but me; that's all the hurt I wish you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Thank you, Mrs. Joyner. Well, I will throw
off Dapperwit's acquaintance when I am married, and
will only be a cully to my wife; and that's no more than
the wisest husband of 'em all is.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Then you think you shall carry Mrs.
Martha?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Your hundred guineas are as good as in your
lap.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But I am afraid this double plot of yours
should fail: you would sooner succeed if you only
designed upon Mrs. Martha, or only upon my Lady
Flippant.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, then, you are no woman of intrigue,
faith and troth: 'tis good to have two strings to one's
bow. If Mrs. Martha be coy, I tell the widow I put on
my disguise for her; but if Mrs. Martha be kind to
Jonas, Sir Simon Addleplot will be false to the widow:
which is no more than widows are used to; for a promise
to a widow is as seldom kept as a vow made at sea, as
Dapperwit says.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I am afraid they should discover you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> You have nothing to fear; you have your
twenty guineas in your pocket for helping me into my
service, and if I get into Mrs. Martha's quarters, you
have a hundred more; if into the widow's, fifty:&mdash;happy
go lucky! Will her ladyship be at your house at the
hour?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Then you shall see when I am Sir Simon
Addleplot and myself I'll look like myself; now I am
Jonas, I look like an ass. You never thought Sir Simon
Addleplot could have looked so like an ass by his
ingenuity.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Pardon me, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, do not flatter, faith and troth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Come let us go, 'tis time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I will carry the widow to the French house.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> If she will go.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> If she will go! why, did you ever know a
widow refuse a treat? no more than a lawyer a fee, faith
and troth: yet I know too&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No treat, sweet words, good mien, but sly intrigue</span><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The French House. A table, wine and
candles.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>, <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's have no drinking to-night.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's have no Dapperwit
to-night.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, nay, Vincent.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> A pox! I hate his impertinent chat more than he
does the honest Burgundy.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But why should you force wine upon us? we are
not all of your gusto.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But why should you force your chawed jests,
your damned ends of your mouldy lampoons, and last
year's sonnets, upon us? we are not all of your gusto.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> The wine makes me sick, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Thy rhymes make me spew.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> At repartee already! Come, Vincent. I know
you would rather have him pledge you: here, Dapperwit&mdash;[<i>Gives
him the glass.</i>]&mdash;But why are you so eager to
have him drink always?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Because he is so eager to talk always, and there
is no other way to silence him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> Here is a gentleman desires to speak with Mr.
Vincent.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I come. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> <i>with</i> Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He may drink, because he is obliged to the
bottle for all the wit and courage he has; 'tis not free
and natural like yours.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> He has more courage than wit, but wants
neither.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> As a pump gone dry, if you pour no water down
you will get none out, so&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, I bar similes too, to-night.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Why, is not the thought new? don't you
apprehend it?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Yes, yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Well, well, will you comply with his sottishness
too, and hate brisk things in complaisance to the ignorant
dull age? I believe shortly 'twill be as hard to find a
patient friend to communicate one's wit to, as a faithful
friend to communicate one's secret to. Wit has as few
true judges as painting, I see.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> All people pretend to be judges of both.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Ay, they pretend; but set you aside, and one or
two more&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But why, has Vincent neither courage nor wit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He has no courage, because he beat his wench
for giving me <i>les doux yeux</i> once; and no wit, because he
does not comprehend my thoughts; and he is a son of a
whore for his ignorance. I take ignorance worse from
any man than the lie, because 'tis as much as to say I am
no wit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p>You need not take any notice, though, to him what I
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Ranger, there is a woman below in a coach
would speak with you.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> With me? [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> This Ranger, Mr. Vincent, is as false to his
friend as his wench.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You have no reason to say so, but because he is
absent.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> 'Tis disobliging to tell a man of his faults to his
face. If he had but your grave parts and manly wit,
I should adore him; but, a pox! he is a mere buffoon, a
jack-pudding, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You are an ungrateful fellow. I have heard him
maintain you had wit, which was more than e'er you
could do for yourself.&mdash;I thought you had owned him
your Mæcenas.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! he cannot but esteem me, 'tis for his
honour; but I cannot but be just for all that&mdash;without
favour or affection. Yet I confess I love him so well,
that I wish he had but the hundredth part of your
courage.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> He has had courage to save you from many a
beating, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come, come, I wish the man well, and, next to
you, better than any man! and, I am sorry to say it, he
has not courage to snuff a candle with his fingers.
When he is drunk, indeed, he dares get a clap, or so&mdash;and
swear at a constable.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Detracting fop! when did you see him desert his
friend?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You have a rough kind of a raillery, Mr.
Vincent; but since you will have it, (though I love the
man heartily, I say,) he deserted me once in breaking of
windows, for fear of the constables&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p>But you need not take notice to him of what I tell you;
I hate to put a man to the blush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I have had just now a visit from my mistress,
who is as jealous of me as a wife of her husband when
she lies in:&mdash;my cousin Lydia,&mdash;you have heard me
speak of her.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But she is more troublesome than a wife that lies
in, because she follows you to your haunts. Why do you
allow her that privilege before her time?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Faith, I may allow her any privilege, and be too
hard for her yet. How do you think I have cheated her
to-night?&mdash;Women are poor credulous creatures, easily
deceived.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> We are poor credulous creatures, when we think
'em so.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Intending a ramble to St. James's Park to-night,
upon some probable hopes of some fresh game I have in
chase, I appointed her to stay at home; with a promise
to come to her within this hour, that she might not spoil
the scent and prevent my sport.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> She'll be even with you when you are married,
I warrant you. In the meantime here's her health,
Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Now had he rather be at the window, writing
her anagram in the glass with his diamond, or biting his
nails in the corner for a fine thought to come and divert
us with at the table.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No, a pox! I have no wit to-night. I am as
barren and hide-bound as one of your damned scribbling
poets, who are sots in company for all their wit; as a
miser is poor for all his money. How do you like the
thought?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Drink, drink!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Well, I can drink this, because I shall be
reprieved presently.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Who will be so civil to us?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Sir Simon Addleplot:&mdash;I have bespoke him a
supper here, for he treats to-night a new rich mistress.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> That spark, who has his fruitless designs upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the bed-ridden rich widow, down to the suckling heiress
in her pissing-clout. He was once the sport, but now
the public grievance, of all the fortunes in town; for he
watches them like a younger brother that is afraid to be
mumped of his snip,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and they cannot steal a marriage,
nor stay their stomachs, but he must know it.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He has now pitched his nets for Gripe's
daughter, the rich scrivener, and serves him as a clerk to
get admission to her; which the watchful fop her father
denies to all others.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I thought you had been nibbling at her once,
under pretence of love to her aunt.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I confess I have the same design yet, and
Addleplot is but my agent, whilst he thinks me his. He
brings me letters constantly from her, and carries mine
back.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Still betraying your best friends!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I cannot in honour but betray him. Let me
perish! the poor young wench is taken with my person,
and would scratch through four walls to come to
me.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> 'Tis a sign she is kept up close indeed.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Betray him! I'll not be traitor to love for any
man.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span> <i>with the</i> Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Know 'em! you are a saucy Jack-straw to
question me, faith and troth; I know everybody, and
everybody knows me.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Sir Simon! Sir Simon! Sir Simon!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> And you are a welcome man to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Now, son of a whore, do I know the gentlemen?&mdash;A
dog! would have had a shilling of me before
he would let me come to you!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> The rogue has been bred at Court, sure.&mdash;Get
you out, sirrah. [<i>Exit</i> Waiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> He has been bred at a French-house, where
they are more unreasonable.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Here's to you, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I cannot drink, for I have a mistress within;
though I would not have the people of the house to
know it.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You need not be ashamed of your mistresses, for
they are commonly rich.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> And because she is rich, I would conceal
her; for I never had a rich mistress yet, but one or
other got her from me presently, faith and troth.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But this is an ill place to conceal a mistress in;
every waiter is an intelligencer to your rivals.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I have a trick for that:&mdash;I'll let no waiters
come into the room; I'll lay the cloth myself rather.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But who is your mistress?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Your servant,&mdash;your servant, Mr. Ranger.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Come, will you pledge me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> No, I'll spare your wine, if you will spare
me Dapperwit's company; I came for that.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You do us a double favour, to take him and
leave the wine.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Come, come, Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Do not go, unless he will suffer us to see his
mistress too. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Come, come, man.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Would you have me so uncivil as to leave my
company?&mdash;they'll take it ill.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I cannot find her talk without thee.&mdash;Pray,
gentlemen, persuade Mr. Dapperwit to go with me.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> We will not hinder him of better company.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Yours is too good to be left rudely.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, gentlemen, I would desire your company
too, if you knew the lady.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> They know her as well as I; you say I know
her not.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> You are not everybody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Perhaps we do know the lady, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> You do not, you do not: none of you ever
saw her in your lives;&mdash;but if you could be secret, and
civil&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> We have drunk yet but our bottle a-piece.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> But will you be civil, Mr. Vincent?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> He dares not look a woman in the face under
three bottles.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Come along then. But can you be civil,
gentlemen? will you be civil, gentlemen? pray be civil
if you can, and you shall see her.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Exit, and returns with</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>and</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> How, has he got his jilt here! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> The widow Flippant! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Is this the woman that we never saw! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Does he bring us into company!&mdash;and
Dapperwit one! Though I had married the fool, I thought
to have reserved the wit as well as other ladies. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, look as long as you will, madam, you
will find them civil gentlemen, and good company.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I am not in doubt of their civility, but yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You'll never leave snubbing your servants!
Did you not promise to use him kindly?
[<i>Aside to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.] 'Tis true.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
We wanted no good company, Sir Simon, as long as we
had yours.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> But they wanted good company, therefore I
forced 'em to accept of yours.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> They will not think the company good they
were forced into, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> A pox! I must be using the words in fashion,
though I never have any luck with 'em. Mrs. Joyner,
help me off.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I suppose, madam, he means the gentlemen
wanted not inclination to your company, but confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to desire so great an honour; therefore he
forced 'em.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What makes this bawd here? Sure, mistress, you
bawds should be like the small cards, though at first you
make up a pack, yet, when the play begins, you should
be put out as useless.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Well, well, gibing companion: you would
have the pimps kept in only? you would so?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What, they are quarrelling!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Pimp and bawd agree now-a-days like doctor
and apothecary.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Try, madam, if they are not civil gentlemen;
talk with 'em, while I go lay the cloth&mdash;no waiter comes
here.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] My mother used to tell me, I should
avoid all occasions of talking before my mistress, because
silence is a sign of love as well as prudence.
[<i>Lays the cloth.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Methinks you look a little yellow on't, Mr.
Dapperwit. I hope you do not censure me because you
find me passing away a night with this fool:&mdash;he is not a
man to be jealous of, sure.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You are not a lady to be jealous of, sure.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> No, certainly.&mdash;But why do you look as if you
were jealous then?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> If I had met you in Whetstone's park,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> with a
drunken foot-soldier, I should not have been jealous of you.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Fy, fy! now you are jealous, certainly; for
people always, when they grow jealous, grow rude:&mdash;but
I can pardon it since it proceeds from love certainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am out of all hopes to be rid of this eternal old
acquaintance: when I jeer her, she thinks herself praised;
now I call her whore in plain English she thinks I am
jealous. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Sweet Mr. Dapperwit, be not so censorious, (I
speak for your sake, not my own,) for jealousy is a great
torment, but my honour cannot suffer certainly.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No, certainly; but the greatest torment I have
is&mdash;your love.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Alas! sweet Mr. Dapperwit, indeed love is a
torment: but 'tis a sweet torment; but jealousy is a
bitter torment.&mdash;I do not go about to cure you of the
torment of my love.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> 'Tis a sign so.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Come, come, look up, man; is that a rival
to contest with you?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I will contest with no rival, not with my old rival
your coachman; but they have heartily my resignation;
and, to do you a favour, but myself a greater, I will help
to tie the knot you are fumbling for now, betwixt your
cully here and you.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Go, go, I take that kind of jealousy worst of
all, to suspect I would be debauched to beastly matrimony.&mdash;But
who are those gentlemen, pray? are they
men of fortunes, Mrs. Joyner?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I believe so.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Do you believe so, indeed?&mdash;Gentlemen&mdash;[<i>Advancing
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> If the civility we owe to ladies had not controlled
our envy to Mr. Dapperwit, we had interrupted
ere this your private conversation.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Your interruption, sir, had been most civil
and obliging;&mdash;for our discourse was of marriage.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> That is a subject, madam, as grateful as common.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> O fy, fy! are you of that opinion too? I cannot
suffer any to talk of it in my company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Are you married then, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> No, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I am sure so much beauty cannot despair of it.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Despair of it!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Only those that are married, or cannot be
married, hate to hear of marriage.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Yet you must know, sir, my aversion to
marriage is such, that you, nor no man breathing, shall
ever persuade me to it.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Cursed be the man should do so rude a thing as
to persuade you to anything against your inclination! I
would not do it for the world, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Come, come, though you seem to be a civil
gentleman, I think you no better than your neighbours.
I do not know a man of you all that will not thrust a
woman up into a corner, and then talk an hour to her
impertinently of marriage.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You would find me another man in a corner, I
assure you, madam; for you should not have a word of
marriage from me, whatsoever you might find in my
actions of it; I hate talking as much as you.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I hate it extremely.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I am your man then, madam; for I find just the
same fault with your sex as you do with ours:&mdash;I ne'er
could have to do with woman in my life, but still she
would be impertinently talking of marriage to me.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Observe that, Mrs. Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's go; I had rather drink
with Mr. Vincent, than stay here with you; besides 'tis
Park-time.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.] I come.&mdash;[<i>To</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.]
Since you are a lady that hate marriage, I'll do
you the service to withdraw the company; for those that
hate marriage hate loss of time.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will you go then, sir? but before you go, sir,
pray tell me is your aversion to marriage real?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> As real as yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> If it were no more real than mine&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Your servant, madam. [<i>Turns to go.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> But do you hate marriage certainly?
[<i>Plucks him back.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Come, I cannot believe it: you dissemble it
only because I pretend it.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Do you but pretend it then, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside</i>] I shall discover myself&mdash;[<i>Aloud</i>] I
mean, because I hold against it, you do the same in
complaisance:&mdash;for I have heard say, cunning men think
to bring the coy and untractable women to tameness
as they do some mad people&mdash;by humouring their
frenzies.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I am none of those cunning men, yet have too
much wit to entertain the presumption of designing upon
you.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> 'Twere no such presumption neither.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come away; 'sdeath! don't you see your
danger?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Those aims are for Sir Simon.&mdash;Good night,
madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will you needs go, then?&mdash;[<i>To</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon</span>]
The gentlemen are a-going, Sir Simon; will you let 'em?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, madam, if you cannot keep 'em, how
should I?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Stay, sir; because you hate marriage, I'll sing
you a new song against it. [<i>Sings.</i></p>

<p>Though it be the fashion for women of quality to sing
any song whatever, because the words are not distinguished,
yet I should have blushed to have done it
now, but for you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> The song is edifying, the voice admirable&mdash;and,
once more, I am your servant, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> What, will you go too, Mr Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Pray, Mr. Dapperwit, do not you go too.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am engaged.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Well, if we cannot have their company, we

they have paid their reckoning, let's go thither again.</p>

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>St. James's Park at night.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger, Vincent,</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit.</span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Hang me, if I am not pleased
extremely with this new-fashioned caterwauling,
this mid-night coursing in the
park.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> A man may come after supper
with his three bottles in his head, reel
himself sober, without reproof from his mother, aunt, or
grave relation.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> May bring his bashful wench, and not have her
put out of countenance by the impudent honest women
of the town.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And a man of wit may have the better of the
dumb show of well-trimmed vest or fair peruke:&mdash;no
man's now is whitest.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> And now no woman's modest or proud; for
her blushes are hid, and the rubies on her lips are dyed,
and all sleepy and glimmering eyes have lost their attraction.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> And now a man may carry a bottle under his
arm instead of his hat;&mdash;and no observing spruce fop
will miss the cravat that lies on one's shoulder, or count
the pimples on one's face.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And now the brisk repartee ruins the complaisant
cringe, or wise grimace.&mdash;Something 'twas, we
men of virtue always loved the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> O blessed season!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> For good-fellows.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> For lovers.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And for the Muses.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> When I was a boy I loved the night so well, I
had a strong vocation to be a bellman's apprentice.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I, a drawer.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And I, to attend the waits of Westminster, let
me perish!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But why do we not do the duty of this and such
other places;&mdash;walk, censure, and speak ill of all we
meet?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> 'Tis no fault of mine, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Fy, fy! satirical gentlemen, this is not your time;
you cannot distinguish a friend from a fop.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No matter, no matter; they will deserve amongst
'em the worst we can say.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Who comes here, Dapperwit?
[<i>People walk slowly over the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> By the toss of his head, training of his feet, and
his elbows playing at bo-peep behind his back, it should
be my Lord Easy.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> And who the woman?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> My Lord what-d'ye-call's daughter, that had a
child by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Dapperwit, hold your tongue.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> How! are you concerned?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Her brother's an honest fellow, and will drink
his glass.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Prithee, Vincent, Dapperwit did not hinder
drinking to-night, though he spake against it; why, then,
should you interrupt his sport?&mdash;Now, let him talk of
anybody.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> So he will,&mdash;till you cut his throat.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Why should you on all occasions thwart him,
contemn him, and maliciously look grave at his jests
only?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Why does he always rail against my friends, then,
and my best friend&mdash;a beer-glass?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Dapperwit, be your own advocate: my game, I
think, is before me there. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> This Ranger, I think, has all the ill qualities of
all your town fops;&mdash;leaving his company for a spruce
lord or a wench.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, if you must rail at your own best friends, I
may forgive you railing at mine.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.&mdash;<i>They walk over the
stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> False Ranger, shall I find thee here? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Those are women, are they not? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dapper</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> The least seems to be my Lucy, sure. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Faith, I think I dare speak to a woman in the
dark!&mdash;let's try.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> They are persons of quality of my acquaintance;&mdash;hold!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, if they are persons of quality of your
acquaintance, I may be the bolder with 'em.
[<i>The</i> Ladies <i>go off, they follow them.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I come hither to make a discovery to-night.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Of my love to you, certainly; for nobody but
you could have debauched me to the Park, certainly. I
would not return another night, if it were to redeem my
dear husband from his grave.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I believe you:&mdash;but to get another, widow.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Another husband, another husband, foh!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> There does not pass a night here but many a
match is made.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> That a woman of honour should have the
word match in her mouth!&mdash;but I hope, madam, the
fellows do not make honourable love here, do they?
I abominate honourable love, upon my honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> If they should make honourable love here, I
know you would prevent 'em.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.&mdash;<i>They walk slowly
towards the</i> Ladies.</p>

<p>But here come two men will inform you what to do.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Do they come?&mdash;are they men certainly?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Prepare for an assault, they'll put you to't.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will they put us to't certainly? I was never
put to't yet. If they should put us to't, I should drop
down, down, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I believe, truly, you would not have power to
run away.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Therefore I will not stay the push.&mdash;They
come! they come! oh, the fellows come!
[Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>runs away,</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>follows, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Vincent</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span> <i>after them.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>at the other side, alone.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> So! I am got off clear! I did not run from
the men, but my companion. For all their brags, men
have hardly courage to set upon us when our number is
equal; now they shall see I defy 'em:&mdash;for we women
have always most courage when we are alone. But, a
pox! the lazy rogues come not! or they are drunk and
cannot run. Oh drink! abominable drink! instead of
inflaming love, it quenches it; and for one lover it
encourages, it makes a thousand impotent. Curse on all
wine! even Rhenish wine and sugar&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot,</span> <i>muffled in a cloak.</i></p>

<p>But fortune will not see me want; here comes a single
bully,&mdash;I wish he may stand;&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For now a-nights the jostling nymph is bolder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than modern satyr with his cloak o'er shoulder.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Well met, sir. [<i>She puts on her mask.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> How shall I know that, forsooth? Who are
you? do you know me?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Who are you? don't you know me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Not I, faith and troth!</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I am glad on't; for no man e'er liked a
woman the better for having known her before.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Ay, but then one can't be so free with a new
acquaintance as with an old one; she may deny one the
civility.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Not till you ask her.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> But I am afraid to be denied.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Let me tell you, sir, you cannot disoblige us
women more than in distrusting us.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Pish! what should one ask for, when you
know one's meaning?&mdash;but shall I deal freely with you?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I love, of my life, men should deal freely with
me; there are so few men will deal freely with one&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Are you not a fireship,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> a punk, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Well, sir, I love raillery.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Faith and troth, I do not rally, I deal freely.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> This is the time and place for freedom, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Are you handsome?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Joan's as good as my lady in the dark,
certainly: but men that deal freely never ask questions,
certainly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> How then! I thought to deal freely, and put
a woman to the question, had been all one.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> But, let me tell you, those that deal freely indeed,
take a woman by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> What, what, what, what?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> By the hand&mdash;and lead her aside.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Now I understand you; come along then.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter behind</i> Musicians <i>with torches.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> What unmannerly rascals are those that bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
light into the Park? 'twill not be taken well from 'em by
the women, certainly.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Still disappointed!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Oh, the fiddles, the fiddles! I sent for them
hither to oblige the women, not to offend 'em; for I
intend to serenade the whole Park to-night. But my
frolic is not without an intrigue, faith and troth: for I
know the fiddles will call the whole herd of vizard masks
together; and then shall I discover if a strayed mistress
of mine be not amongst 'em, whom I treated to-night at
the French-house; but as soon as the jilt had eat up my
meat and drunk her two bottles, she ran away from me,
and left me alone.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> How! is it he? Addleplot!&mdash;that I could not
know him by his faith and troth! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Now I would understand her tricks; because
I intend to marry her, and should be glad to know what
I must trust to.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> So thou shalt;&mdash;but not yet. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Though I can give a great guess already;
for if I have any intrigue or sense in me, she is as arrant
a jilt as ever pulled pillow from under husband's head,
faith and troth. Moreover she is bow-legged, hopper-hipped,
and, betwixt pomatum and Spanish red, has a
complexion like a Holland cheese, and no more teeth left
than such as give a <i>haut goût</i> to her breath; but she is
rich, faith and troth.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Oh rascal! he has heard somebody
else say all this of me. But I must not discover myself,
lest I should be disappointed of my revenge; for I will
marry him. [<i>The</i> Musicians <i>approaching, exit</i> <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> What, gone!&mdash;come then, strike up, my lads.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Men <i>and</i> Women <i>in vizards&mdash;a Dance, during
which</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span>, <i>for the most part,
stands still in a cloak and vizard; but sometimes goes
about peeping, and examining the</i> Women's <i>clothes&mdash;the
Dance ended, all exeunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, <i>after them</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit.</span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Nay, if you stay any longer, I
must leave you again. [<i>Going off.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> We have overtaken them at last again. These
are they: they separate too; and that's but a challenge
to us.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Let me perish! ladies&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Nay, good madam, let's unite, now here's the
common enemy upon us.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Damn me! ladies&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Hold, a pox! you are too rough.&mdash;Let me
perish! ladies&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Not for want of breath, gentlemen:&mdash;we'll stay
rather.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> For want of your favour rather, sweet ladies.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] That's Dapperwit, false villain! but
he must not know I am here. If he should, I should
lose his thrice agreeable company, and he would run
from me as fast as from the bailiffs. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] What!
you will not talk with 'em, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Yes, but I will.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Then you are a Park-woman certainly, and
you will take it kindly if I leave you.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> No, you must not leave me.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Then you must leave them.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I'll see if they are worse company than you, first.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Monstrous impudence!&mdash;will you not come?
[<i>Pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, madam, I never suffer any violence to be
used to a woman but what I do myself: she must stay,
and you must not go.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Unhand me, you rude fellow!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, now I am sure you will stay and be kind;
for coyness in a woman is as little sign of true modesty,
as huffing in a man is of true courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Use her gently, and speak soft things to her.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now do I guess I know my coxcomb.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.] Sir, I am extremely glad I am fallen
into the hands of a gentleman that can speak soft things;
and this is so fine a night to hear soft things in;&mdash;morning,
I should have said.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> It will not be morning, dear madam, till you
pull off your mask.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] That I think was brisk.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Indeed, dear sir, my face would frighten back
the sun.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> With glories more radiant than his own.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I keep up with her, I think.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But why would you put me to the trouble of
lighting the world, when I thought to have gone to
sleep?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You only can do it, dear madam, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But why would you (of all men) practise treason
against your friend Ph&#339;bus, and depose him for a mere
stranger?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I think she knows me. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But he does not do you justice, I believe; and
you are so positively cock-sure of your wit, you would
refer to a mere stranger your plea to the bay-tree.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> She jeers me, let me perish! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Dapperwit, a little of your aid; for my lady's invincibly
dumb.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Would mine had been so too! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I have used as many arguments to make her
speak, as are requisite to make other women hold their
tongues.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Well, I am ready to change sides.&mdash;Yet before
I go, madam, since the moon consents now I should see
your face, let me desire you to pull off your mask; which
to a handsome lady is a favour, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Truly, sir, I must not be long in debt to you for
the obligation; pray let me hear you recite some of your
verses; which to a wit is a favour, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Madam, it belongs to your sex to be obliged
first; pull off your mask, and I'll pull out my paper.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
Brisk again, of my side.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> 'Twould be in vain, for you would want a candle
now.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I dare not make use again of the lustre
of her face.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] I'll wait upon you home then,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Faith, no; I believe it will not be much to our
advantages to bring my face or your poetry to light: for
I hope you have yet a pretty good opinion of my face,
and so have I of your wit. But if you are for proving
your wit, why do not you write a play?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Because 'tis now no more reputation to write a
play, than it is honour to be a knight. Your true wit
despises the title of poet, as much as your true gentleman
the title of knight; for as a man may be a knight and no
gentleman, so a man may be a poet and no wit, let me
perish!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Pray, sir, how are you dignified or distinguished
amongst the rates of wits? and how many rates are
there?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> There are as many degrees of wits as of lawyers:
as there is first your solicitor, then your attorney, then
your pleading-counsel, then your chamber-counsel, and
then your judge; so there is first your court-wit, your
coffee-wit, your poll-wit, or politic-wit, your chamber-wit,
or scribble-wit, and last of all, your judge-wit, or critic.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But are there as many wits as lawyers? Lord,
what will become of us!&mdash;What employment can they
have? how are they known?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> First, your court-wit is a fashionable, insinuating,
flattering, cringing, grimacing fellow&mdash;and has wit enough
to solicit a suit of love; and if he fail, he has malice
enough to ruin the woman with a dull lampoon:&mdash;but he
rails still at the man that is absent, for you must know all
wits rail; and his wit properly lies in combing perukes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
matching ribbons, and being severe, as they call it, upon
other people's clothes.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Now, what is the coffee-wit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He is a lying, censorious, gossiping, quibbling
wretch, and sets people together by the ears over that sober
drink, coffee: he is a wit, as he is a commentator, upon
the Gazette; and he rails at the pirates of Algier, the
Grand Signior of Constantinople, and the Christian
Grand Signior.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> What kind of man is your poll-wit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He is a fidgetting, busy, dogmatical, hot-headed
fop, that speaks always in sentences and proverbs, (as
other in similitudes,) and he rails perpetually against the
present government. His wit lies in projects and monopolies,
and penning speeches for young parliament men.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But what is your chamber-wit, or scribble-wit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He is a poring, melancholy, modest sot, ashamed
of the world: he searches all the records of wit, to compile
a breviate of them for the use of players, printers,
booksellers, and sometimes cooks, tobacco-men; he employs
his railing against the ignorance of the age, and all
that have more money than he.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Now your last.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Your judge-wit, or critic, is all these together,
and yet has the wit to be none of them: he can think,
speak, write, as well as the rest, but scorns (himself a
judge) to be judged by posterity: he rails at all the other
classes of wits, and his wit lies in damning all but himself:&mdash;he
is your true wit.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Then, I suspect you are of his form.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I cannot deny it, madam.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Dapperwit, you have been all this time on the
wrong side; for you love to talk all, and here's a lady
would not have hindered you.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! I have been talking too long indeed
here; for wit is lost upon a silly weak woman, as well as
courage. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I have used all common means to move a
woman's tongue and mask; I called her ugly, old, and
old acquaintance, and yet she would not disprove me:&mdash;but
here comes Ranger, let him try what he can do; for,
since my mistress is dogged, I'll go sleep alone. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ranger! 'tis he indeed: I am sorry he
is here, but glad I discovered him before I went. Yet
he must not discover me, lest I should be prevented
hereafter in finding him out. False Ranger!&mdash;[<i>To</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.] Nay, if they bring fresh force upon us,
madam, 'tis time to quit the field.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> What, play with your quarry till it fly from you!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You frighten it away.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Ha! is not one of those ladies in mourning?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> All women are so by this light.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But you might easily discern. Don't you know
her?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Did you talk with her?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Yes, she is one of your brisk silly baggages.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> 'Tis she, 'tis she!&mdash;I was afraid I saw her before;
let us follow 'em: prithee make haste.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] 'Tis
Lydia. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter, on the other side</i>, <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Flippant&mdash;Dapperwit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>following them at a distance.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> They follow us yet, I fear.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> You do not fear it certainly; otherwise you
would not have encouraged them.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> For Heaven's sake, madam, waive your quarrel a
little, and let us pass by your coach, and so on foot to your
acquaintance in the old Pall-mall<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>: for I would not be discovered

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Christina's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> For Heaven's sake, undress yourself, madam!
They'll not return to-night: all people have left the Park
an hour ago.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What is't o'clock?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> 'Tis past one.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> It cannot be!</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> I thought that time had only stolen from happy
lovers:&mdash;the disconsolate have nothing to do but to tell
the clock.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I can only keep account with my misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> I am glad they are not innumerable.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> And, truly, my undergoing so often your impertinency
is not the least of them.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> I am then more glad, madam, for then they cannot
be great; and it is in my power, it seems, to make
you in part happy, if I could but hold this villainous
tongue of mine: but then let the people of the town hold
their tongues if they will, for I cannot but tell you what
they say.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What do they say?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Faith, madam, I am afraid to tell you, now I
think on't.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Is it so ill?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> O, such base, unworthy things!</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Do they say I was really Clerimont's wench, as he
boasted; and that the ground of the quarrel betwixt
Valentine and him was not Valentine's vindication of my
honour, but Clerimont's jealousy of him?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Worse, worse a thousand times! such villainous
things to the utter ruin of your reputation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What are they?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Faith, madam, you'll be angry: 'tis the old trick
of lovers to hate their informers, after they have made 'em
such.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I will not be angry.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> They say then, since Mr. Valentine's flying into
France you are grown mad, have put yourself into
mourning, live in a dark room, where you'll see nobody,
nor take any rest day or night, but rave and talk to yourself
perpetually.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Now, what else?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> But the surest sign of your madness is, they say,
because you are desperately resolved (in case my Lord
Clerimont should die of his wounds) to transport yourself
and fortune into France to Mr. Valentine, a man that
has not a groat to return you in exchange.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> All this, hitherto, is true; now to the rest.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Indeed, madam, I have no more to tell you. I
was sorry, I'm sure, to hear so much of any lady of
mine.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Insupportable insolence!</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] This is some revenge for my want of sleep
to-night.&mdash;[<i>Knocking at the door.</i>] So, I hope my old
second is come; 'tis seasonable relief. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Unhappy Valentine! couldst thou but see how
soon thy absence and misfortunes have disbanded all thy
friends, and turned thy slaves all renegadoes, thou sure
wouldst prize my only faithful heart!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant, Lydia</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Hail, faithful shepherdess! but, truly, I had
not kept my word with you, in coming back to-night, if
it had not been for this lady, who has her intrigues too
with the fellows as well as you.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Madam, under my Lady Flippant's protection, I
am confident to beg yours; being just now pursued out
of the Park by a relation of mine, by whom it imports me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
extremely not to be discovered:&mdash;[<i>Knocking at the door.</i>]
but I fear he is now at the door.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>, <i>who goes
out.</i>] Let me desire you to deny me to him courageously;&mdash;for
he will hardly believe he can be mistaken in
me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> In such an occasion, where impudence is
requisite, she will serve you as faithfully as you can
wish, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Come, come, madam, do not upbraid her with
her assurance, a qualification that only fits her for a lady's
service. A fine woman of the town can be no more without
a woman that can make an excuse with assurance,
than she can be without a glass, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> She needs no advocate.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> How can any one alone manage an amorous
intrigue? though the birds are tame, somebody must help
draw the net. If 'twere not for a woman that could make
an excuse with assurance, how should we wheedle, jilt,
trace, discover, countermine, undermine, and blow up the
stinking fellows? which is all the pleasure I receive, or
design by them; for I never admitted a man to my conversation,
but for his punishment, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Nobody will doubt that, certainly.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Madam, the gentleman will not be mistaken: he
says you are here, he saw you come in; he is your relation,
his name's Ranger, and is come to wait upon you
home. I had much ado to keep him from coming up.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span>.] Madam, for Heaven's sake, help
me! 'tis yet in your power; if but, while I retire into
your dining-room, you will please to personate me, and
own yourself for her he pursued out of the Park: you are
in mourning too, and your stature so much mine it will
not contradict you.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I am sorry, madam, I must dispute any command
of yours. I have made a resolution to see the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of no man, till an unfortunate friend of mine, now out of
the kingdom, return.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> By that friend, and by the hopes you have to see
him, let me conjure you to keep me from the sight of mine
now. Dear madam, let your charity prevail over you
superstition.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> He comes, he comes, madam!
[<span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>withdraws, and stands unseen at the door.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Ha! this is no Lydia. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What, unworthy defamer, has encouraged you to
offer this insolence?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> She is liker Lydia in her style than her face. I
see I am mistaken; but to tell her I followed her for
another, were an affront rather than an excuse. She's a
glorious creature! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Tell me, sir, whence had you reason for this
your rude pursuit of me, into my lodgings, my chamber?
why should you follow me?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Faith, madam, because you ran away from me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> That was no sign of an acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You'll pardon me, madam.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Then, it seems, you mistook me for another,
and the night is your excuse, which blots out all
distinctions. But now you are satisfied in your mistake,
I hope you will seek out your woman in another
place.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Madam, I allow not the excuse you make for me.
If I have offended, I will rather be condemned for my
love, than pardoned for my insensibility.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> How's that? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What do you say?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Though the night had been darker, my heart
would not have suffered me to follow any one but
you:&mdash;he has been too long acquainted with you to
mistake you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> What means this tenderness? he mistook me for
her sure. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What says the gentleman? did you know me
then, sir?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Not I, the devil take me! but I must on
now.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Could you imagine, madam, by the innumerable
crowd of your admirers, you had left any man
free in the town, or ignorant of the power of your beauty?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I never saw your face before, that I remember.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Ah, madam! you would never regard your
humblest slave; I was till now a modest lover.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Falsest of men! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> My woman said, you came to seek a relation
here, not a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I must confess, madam, I thought you would
sooner disprove my dissembled error, than admit my
visit, and was resolved to see you.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> 'Tis clear! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Indeed, when I followed you first out of the
Park, I was afraid you might have been a certain relation
of mine, for your statures and habits are the same; but
when you entered here, I was with joy convinced.
Besides, I would not for the world have given her
troublesome love so much encouragement, to have
disturbed my future addresses to you; for the foolish
woman does perpetually torment me to make our relation
nearer; but never more in vain than since I have seen
you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> How! shall I suffer this? 'tis clear he disappointed
me to-night for her, and made me stay at
home that I might not disappoint him of her company
in the Park. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I am amazed! but let me tell you, sir, if the
lady were here, I would satisfy her the sight of me should
never frustrate her ambitious designs upon her cruel
kinsman.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I wish you could satisfy me. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> If she were here, she would satisfy you she were
not capable of the honour to be taken for you:&mdash;though
in the dark. Faith, my cousin is but a tolerable woman
to a man that had not seen you.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Sure, to my plague, this is the first time you
ever saw me!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Sure, to the plague of my poor heart, 'tis not the
hundredth time I have seen you! For, since the time I
saw you first, you have not been at the Park, playhouse,
Exchange,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> or other public place, but I saw you; for it
was my business to watch and follow.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Pray, when did you see me last at the Park,
playhouse, or Exchange?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Some two, three days, or a week ago.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I have not been this month out of this chamber.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> That is to delude me. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I knew you were mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You'll pardon a lover's memory, madam.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
A pox! I have hanged myself in my own line.
One would think my perpetual ill-luck in lying should
break me of the quality; but, like a losing gamester, I
am still for pushing on, till none will trust me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Come, sir, you run out of one error into a
greater: you would excuse the rudeness of your mistake,
and intrusion at this hour into my lodgings, with your
gallantry to me,&mdash;more unseasonable and offensive.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, I am in love I see, for I blush and have not
a word to say for myself.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> But, sir, if you will needs play the gallant, pray
leave my house before morning, lest you should be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
go hence, to the scandal of my honour. Rather than
that should be, I'll call up the house and neighbours to
bear witness I bid you begone.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Since you take a night visit so ill, madam, I will
never wait upon you again but by day. I go, that I may
hope to return; and, for once, I wish you a good night
without me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Good night, for as long as I live.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> And good night to my love, I'm sure. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Though I have done you an inconsiderable
service, I assure you, madam, you are not a little obliged
to me.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Pardon me, dear Valentine!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I know not yet whether I am more obliged than
injured: when I do, I assure you, madam, I shall not be
insensible of either.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I fear, madam, you are as liable to mistakes as
your kinsman.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I fear I am more subject to 'em: it may be for
want of sleep, therefore I'll go home.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> My Lady Flippant, good night.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Good night, or rather good morrow, faithful
shepherdess.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I'll wait on you down.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Your coach stays yet, I hope.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Certainly. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>The Street before</i> <span class="smcap">Christina's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I was a faithful sentinel: nobody came out, let
me perish!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> No, no, I hunted upon a wrong scent; I thought
I had followed a woman, but found her an angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What is her name?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> That you must tell me. What very fine woman
is there lives hereabouts?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Faith, I know not any. She is, I warrant you,
some fine woman of a term's standing or so in the town;
such as seldom appear in public, but in their balconies,
where they stand so constantly, one would think they had
hired no other part of the house.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> And look like the pictures which painters expose
to draw in customers;&mdash;but I must know who she is.
Vincent's lodging is hard by, I'll go and inquire of him,
and lie with him to-night: but if he will not let me, I'll
lie with you, for my lodging is too far off.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Then I will go before, and expect you at mine.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vincent's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>in a riding habit, as
newly from a journey.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Your mistress, dear Valentine, will not be more
glad to see you! but my wonder is no less than my
joy, that you would return ere you were informed Clerimont
were out of danger. His surgeons themselves
have not been assured of his recovery till within these
two days.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I feared my mistress, not my life. My life I
could trust again with my old enemy Fortune; but no
longer my mistress in the hands of my greater enemies,
her relations.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Your fear was in the wrong place, then: for
though my Lord Clerimont live, he and his relations may
put you in more danger of your life than your mistress's
relations can of losing her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Would any could secure me her! I would myself
secure my life, for I should value it then.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Come, come; her relations can do you no hurt.
I dare swear, if her mother should but say, "Your hat
did not cock handsomely," she would never ask her
blessing again.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Prithee leave thy fooling, and tell me if, since
my departure, she has given evidences of her love, to
clear those doubts I went away with:&mdash;for as absence is
the bane of common and bastard love, 'tis the vindication
of that which is true and generous.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, if you could ever doubt her love, you deserve
to doubt on; for there is no punishment great enough
for jealousy&mdash;but jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> You may remember, I told you before my flight
I had quarrelled with the defamer of my mistress, but I
thought I had killed my rival.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But pray give me now the answer which the
suddenness of your flight denied me;&mdash;how could Clerimont
hope to subdue her heart by the assault of her
honour?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Pish! it might be the stratagem of a rival to make
me desist.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> For shame! if 'twere not rather to vindicate her,
than satisfy you, I would not tell you how like a Penelope
she has behaved herself in your absence.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Let me know.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Then know, the next day you went she put herself
in mourning, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> That might be for Clerimont, thinking him dead,
as all the world besides thought.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Still turning the dagger's point on yourself! hear
me out. I say she put herself into mourning for you&mdash;locked
herself in her chamber this month for you&mdash;shut
out her barking relations for you&mdash;has not seen the sun
or the face of man since she saw you&mdash;thinks and talks
of nothing but you&mdash;sends to me daily to hear of you&mdash;and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and, in short, (I think,) is mad for you. All this I can
swear; for I am to her so near a neighbour, and so inquisitive
a friend for you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Servant.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Mr. Ranger, sir, is coming up.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What brings him now? he comes to lie with me.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Who, Ranger?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Yes. Pray retire a little, till I send him off:&mdash;unless
you have a mind to have your arrival published to-morrow
in the coffee houses.
[<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>retires to the door behind.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> What! not yet a-bed? your man is laying you
to sleep with usquebaugh or brandy; is he not so?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What punk<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> will not be troubled with you to-night,
therefore I am?&mdash;is it not so?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I have been turned out of doors, indeed, just
now, by a woman,&mdash;but such a woman, Vincent!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Yes, yes, your women are always such women!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> A neighbour of yours, and I'm sure the finest
you have.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Prithee do not asperse my neighbourhood with
your acquaintance; 'twould bring a scandal upon an
alley.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, I do not know her; therefore I come to
you.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> 'Twas no wonder she turned you out of doors,
then; and if she had known you, 'twould have been a
wonder she had let you stay. But where does she live?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Five doors off, on the right hand.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Pish! pish!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Does she live there, do you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Yes; I observed them exactly, that my account
from you might be exact. Do you know who lives there?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Yes, so well, that I know you are mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Is she not a young lady scarce eighteen, of
extraordinary beauty, her stature next to low, and in
mourning?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> What is this? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> She is; but if you saw her, you broke in at
window.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I chased her home from the Park, indeed, taking
her for another lady who had some claim to my heart, till
she showed a better title to't.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Hah! hah! hah!</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Was she at the Park, then? and have I a new
rival? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> From the Park did you follow her, do you say?&mdash;I
knew you were mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I tell you I am not.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> If you are sure it was that house, it might be
perhaps her woman stolen to the Park, unknown to her
lady.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> My acquaintance does usually begin with the
maid first, but now 'twas with the mistress, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> The mistress!&mdash;I tell you she has not been out
of her doors since Valentine's flight. She is his mistress,&mdash;the
great heiress, Christina.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I tell you then again, I followed that Christina
from the Park home, where I talked with her half an
hour, and intend to see her to morrow again.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Would she talk with him too! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> It cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Christina do you call her? Faith I am sorry
she is an heiress, lest it should bring the scandal of
interest, and the design of lucre, upon my love.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> No, no, her face and virtues will free you from
that censure. But, however, 'tis not fairly done to rival
your friend Valentine in his absence; and when he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
present you know 'twill be dangerous, by my Lord Clerimont's
example. Faith, if you have seen her, I would
not advise you to attempt it again.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You may be merry, sir, you are not in love;
your advice I come not for, nor will I for your assistance;&mdash;Good
night. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Here's your Penelope! the woman that had not
seen the sun, nor face of man, since my departure! for
it seems she goes out in the night, when the sun is absent,
and faces are not distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Why! do you believe him?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Should I believe you?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> 'Twere more for your interest, and you would be
less deceived. If you believe him, you must doubt the
chastity of all the fine women in town, and five miles
about.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> His reports of them will little invalidate his
testimony with me.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> He spares not the innocents in bibs and aprons.
I'll secure you, he has made (at best) some gross mistake
concerning Christina, which to-morrow will discover; in
the meantime let us go to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I will not hinder you, because I cannot enjoy it
myself:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hunger, Revenge, to sleep are petty foes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But only Death the jealous eyes can close.</span><br />

<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Good morrow, gossip.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Good morrow;&mdash;but why
up so early, good gossip?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> My care and passionate
concern for you and yours would not
let me rest, in truly.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> For me and mine?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You know we have known one another
long; I think it be some nine-and-thirty years since you
were married.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Nine-and thirty years old, mistress! I'd
have you to know, I am no far-born child; and if the
register had not been burned in the last great fire, alas!&mdash;but
my face needs no register sure; nine-and-thirty years
old, said you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I said you had been so long married; but,
indeed, you bear your years as well as any she in Pepper-alley.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Nine-and-thirty, mistress!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> This it is; a woman, now-a-days, had
rather you should find her faulty with a man, I warrant
you, than discover her age, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Marry, and 'tis the greatest secret far.
Tell a miser he is rich, and a woman she is old,&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
will get no money of him, not kindness of her. To tell
me I was nine-and-thirty&mdash;(I say no more) 'twas un-neighbourly
done of you, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> My memory confesses my age, it seems, as
much as my face; for I thought&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Pray talk nor think no more of any one's
age; but say what brought you hither so early.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> How does my sweet god-daughter, poor
wretch?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Well, very well.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Ah, sweet creature! Alas! alas!&mdash;I am
sorry for her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Why, what has she done to deserve your
sorrow, or my reprehension?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <i>and stands unseen at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What, are they talking of me? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> In short, she was seen going into the meeting-house
of the wicked, otherwise called the playhouse,
hand in hand with that vile fellow Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Mr. Dapperwit! let me tell you, if 'twere
not for Master Dapperwit, we might have lived all this
vacation upon green cheese, tripe, and ox cheek. If he
had it, we should not want it; but, poor gentleman! it
often goes hard with him,&mdash;for he's a wit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> So, then, you are the dog to be fed, while
the house is broken up! I say, beware! The sweet bits
you swallow will make your daughter's belly swell,
mistress; and, after all your junkets, there will be a bone
for you to pick, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Sure, Master Dapperwit is no such manner
of man!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> He is a wit, you say; and what are wits,
but contemners of matrons, seducers, or defamers of
married women, and deflowerers of helpless virgins,
even in the streets, upon the very bulks<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; affronters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
midnight magistracy, and breakers of windows? in a
word&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> But he is a little wit, a modest wit, and
they do no such outrageous things as your great wits do.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, I dare say, he will not say himself he
is a little wit if you ask him.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Nay, I cannot hear this with patience.&mdash;[<i>Comes
forward.</i>] With your pardon, mother, you are as much
mistaken as my godmother in Mr. Dapperwit; for he is
as great a wit as any, and in what he speaks or writes as
happy as any. I can assure you, he contemns all your
tearing wits, in comparison of himself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Alas, poor young wretch! I cannot blame
thee so much as thy mother, for thou art not thyself. His
bewitching madrigals have charmed thee into some
heathenish imp with a hard name.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Nymph, you mean, godmother.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But you, gossip, know what's what. Yesterday,
as I told you, a fine old alderman of the city, seeing
your daughter in so ill hands as Dapperwit's, was
zealously, and in pure charity, bent upon her redemption;
and has sent me to tell you, he will take her into his care
and relieve your necessities, if you think good.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Will he relieve all our necessities?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> All.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Mine, as well as my daughter's?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Well fare his heart!&mdash;D'ye hear, daughter,
Mrs. Joyner has satisfied me clearly; Dapperwit is a vile
fellow, and, in short, you must put an end to that scandalous
familiarity between you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Leave sweet Mr. Dapperwit!&mdash;oh furious ingratitude!
Was he not the man that gave me my first
Farrendon<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> gown, put me out of worsted stockings and
handkerchiefs, taught me to dress, talk, and move
well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> He has taught you to talk indeed; but,
huswife, I will not have my pleasure disputed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, indeed, you are too tart with her,
poor sweet soul.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He taught me to rehearse, too,&mdash;would have
brought me into the playhouse, where I might have had
as good luck as others: I might have had good clothes,
plate, jewels, and things so well about me, that my neighbours,
the little gentlemen's wives of fifteen hundred or
two thousand pounds a year, should have retired into the
country, sick with envy of my prosperity and greatness.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> If you follow your mother's counsel, you
are like to enjoy all you talk of sooner than by Dapperwit's
assistance:&mdash;a poor wretch that goes on tick for the
paper he writes his lampoons on, and the very ale and
coffee that inspire him, as they say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> I am credibly informed so, indeed, Madam
Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Well, I have discharged my conscience;
good morrow to you both. [<i>Exeunt severally.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite's</span> <i>Dining-room.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> This is the cabinet in which I hide my jewel; a
small house, in an obscure, little, retired street, too.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Vulgarly, an alley.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Nay, I hide my mistress with as much care as a
spark of the town does his money from his dun after a
good hand at play; and nothing but you could have
wrought upon me for a sight of her, let me perish.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> My obligation to you is great; do not lessen it
by delays of the favour you promised.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But do not censure my honour; for if you had
not been in a desperate condition,&mdash;for as one nail must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
beat out another, one poison expel another, one fire draw
out another, one fit of drinking cure the sickness of
another,&mdash;so, the surfeit you took last night of Christina's
eyes shall be cured by Lucy's this morning; or as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, I bar more similitudes.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What, in my mistress's lodging? that were as
hard as to bar a young parson in the pulpit, the fifth of
November, railing at the Church of Rome; or as hard as
to put you to bed to Lucy and defend you from touching
her; or as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Or as hard as to make you hold your tongue.&mdash;I
shall not see your mistress, I see.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy!&mdash;[<i>Knocks at the door
and returns.</i>]&mdash;The devil take me, if good men (I say no
more) have not been upon their knees to me, to see her,
and you at last must obtain it.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I do not believe you.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> 'Tis such as she; she is beautiful without affectation;
amorous without impertinency; airy and brisk
without impudence; frolic without rudeness; and, in a
word, the justest creature breathing to her assignation.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You praise her as if you had a mind to part with
her; and yet you resolve, I see, to keep her to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Keep her! poor creature, she cannot leave me;
and rather than leave her, I would leave writing lampoons
or sonnets almost.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Well, I'll leave you with her then.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What, will you go without seeing her?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Rather than stay without seeing her.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Yes, yes, you shall see her; but let me perish if
I have not been offered a hundred guineas for a sight of
her; by&mdash;I say no more.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I understand you now.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] If the
favour be to be purchased, then I'll bid all I have about
me for't.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Fy, fy, Mr. Ranger! you are pleasant, i'faith. Do
you think I would sell the sight of my rarity?&mdash;like those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
gentlemen who hang out flags at Charing Cross, or
like&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, then I'm gone again.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What, you take it ill I refuse your money? rather
than that should be, give us it; but take notice I will
borrow it. Now I think on't, Lucy wants a gown and
some knacks.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Here.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But I must pay it you again: I will not take it
unless you engage your honour I shall pay it you again.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You must pardon me; I will not engage my
honour for such a trifle. Go, fetch her out.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Well, she's a ravishing creature: such eyes and
lips, Mr. Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Prithee go.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Such neck and breasts, Mr. Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Again, prithee go.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Such feet, legs, and thighs, Mr. Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Prithee let me see 'em.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And a mouth no bigger than your ring!&mdash;I need
say no more.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Would thou wert never to speak again!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And then so neat, so sweet a creature in bed,
that, to my knowledge, she does not change her sheets in
half a year.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I thank you for that allay to my impatience.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Miss!&mdash;[<i>Knocking
at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Will she not open? I am afraid my pretty miss
is not stirring, and therefore will not admit us. Is she
not gone her walk to Lamb's Conduit?<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Fy, fy, a quibble next your stomach in a morning!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
What if she should hear us? would you lose a
mistress for a quibble? that's more than I could do, let
me perish!&mdash;She's within, I hear her.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But she will not hear you; she's as deaf as if
you were a dun or a constable.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Pish! give her but leave to gape, rub her eyes,
and put on her day pinner; the long patch under the
left eye; awaken the roses on her cheeks with some
Spanish wool, and warrant her breath with some lemon-peel;
the doors fly off the hinges, and she into my arms.
She knows there is as much artifice to keep a victory as
to gain it; and 'tis a sign she values the conquest of my
heart.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I thought her beauty had not stood in need of art.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Beauty's a coward still without the help of art,
and may have the fortune of a conquest but cannot keep
it. Beauty and art can no more be asunder than love
and honour.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Or, to speak more like yourself, wit and judgment.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Don't you hear the door wag yet?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Not a whit.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Miss! miss! 'tis your slave that calls. Come,
all this tricking for him!&mdash;Lend me your comb, Mr.
Ranger.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> No, I am to be preferred to-day, you are to set
me off. You are in possession, I will not lend you arms
to keep me out.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! don't let me be ungrateful; if she has
smugged herself up for me, let me prune and flounce my
peruke a little for her. There's ne'er a young fellow in
the town but will do as much for a mere stranger in the
playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> A wit's wig has the privilege of being uncombed
in the very playhouse, or in the presence.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But not in the presence of his mistress; 'tis a
greater neglect of her than himself. Pray lend me your
comb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I would not have men of wit and courage make
use of every fop's mean arts to keep or gain a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But don't you see every day, though a man have
never so much wit and courage, his mistress will revolt
to those fops that wear and comb perukes well. I'll
break off the bargain, and will not receive you my
partner.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Therefore you see I am setting up for myself.
[<i>Combs his peruke.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> She comes, she comes!&mdash;pray, your comb.
[<i>Snatches</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger's</span> <i>comb.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Bargain!&mdash;what, are you offering us to
sale?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! is't she?&mdash;Here take your comb again,
then. [<i>Returns the comb.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Would you sell us? 'tis like you, y'fads.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Sell thee!&mdash;where should we find a chapman?
Go, prithee, mother, call out my dear Miss Lucy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Your Miss Lucy! I do not wonder you
have the conscience to bargain for us behind our backs,
since you have the impudence to claim a propriety in us
to my face.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> How's this, Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come, come, this gentleman will not think the
worse of a woman for my acquaintance with her. He has
seen me bring your daughter to the lure with a chiney-orange,
from one side of the playhouse to the other.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> I would have the gentleman and you to
know my daughter is a girl of reputation, though she has
been seen in your company; but is now so sensible of
her past danger, that she is resolved never more to venture
her pitcher to the well, as they say.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> How's that, widow? I wonder at your confidence.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> I wonder at your old impudence, that
where you have had so frequent repulses you should provoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
another, and bring your friend here to witness your
disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Hark you, widow, a little.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> What, have you mortgaged my daughter to
that gentleman; and now would offer me a snip to join
in the security!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] She overhead me talk of a bargain;&mdash;'twas
unlucky.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Your wrath is grounded upon a
mistake; Miss Lucy herself shall be judge; call her out,
pray.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> She shall not; she will not come to you.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Till I hear it from her own mouth, I cannot
believe it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> You shall hear her say't through the door.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I shall doubt it unless she say it to my face.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Shall we be troubled with you no more
then?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> If she command my death, I cannot disobey her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Come out, child.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <i>holding down her head.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Your servant, dearest miss: can you have&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Let me ask her.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No, I'll ask her.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I'll throw up cross or pile<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who shall ask her.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Can you have the heart to say you will never
more break a cheese-cake with me at New Spring Garden,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the
Neat-house, or Chelsea? never more sit in my lap at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a new play? never more wear a suit of knots of my
choice? and, last of all, never more pass away an afternoon
with me again in the Green Garret?&mdash;do not forget
the Green Garret.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I wish I had never seen the Green Garret.&mdash;Damn
the Green Garret!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Damn the Green Garret!&mdash;You are strangely
altered!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> 'Tis you are altered.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You have refused Colby's Mulberry-garden, and
the French houses, for the Green Garret; and a little
something in the Green Garret pleased you more than
the best treat the other places could yield; and can you
of a sudden quit the Green Garret?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Since you have a design to pawn me for the
rent, 'tis time to remove my goods.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Thou art extremely mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Besides, I have heard such strange things of you
this morning.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What things?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I blush to speak 'em.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I know my innocence, therefore take my charge
as a favour. What have I done?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Then know, vile wit, my mother has confessed
just now thou wert false to me, to her too certain
knowledge; and hast forced even her to be false to
me too.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Faults in drink, Lucy, when we are not ourselves,
should not condemn us.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And now to let me out to hire like a hackney!&mdash;I
tell you my own dear mother shall bargain for me no
more; there are as little as I can bargain for themselves
now-a-days, as well as properer women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Whispering all this while!&mdash;Beware of his
snares again: come away, child.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Sweet, dear miss&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Bargain for me!&mdash;you have reckoned without
your hostess, as they say. Bargain for me! bargain
for me! [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I must return, then, to treat with you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Treat me no treatings, but take a word for
all. You shall no more dishonour my daughter, nor
molest my lodgings, as you have done at all hours.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Do you intend to change 'em, then, to Bridewell,
or Long's powdering-tub?<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> No, to a bailiff's house, and then you'll be
so civil, I presume, as not to trouble us.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Here, will you have my comb again, Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! I think women take inconstancy from
me worse than from any man breathing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Pray, sir, forget me before you write your
next lampoon. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span> <i>in the dress of a</i> Clerk.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ranger</span>
<i>retires to the background.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Have I found you? have I found you in
your by-walks, faith and troth? I am almost out of
breath in following you. Gentlemen when they get into
an alley walk so fast, as if they had more earnest business
there than in the broad streets.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;How came this sot hither? Fortune
has sent him to ease my choler.&mdash;You impudent rascal, who
are you, that dare intrude thus on us? [<i>Strikes him.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Don't you know me, Dapperwit? sure you
know me. [<i>Softly.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Will thou dishonour me with thy acquaintance
too? thou rascally, insolent, pen-and-ink man.
[<i>Strikes him again.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Oh! oh! sure you know me! pray know me.
[<i>Softly.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> By thy saucy familiarity, thou shouldst be a marker
at a tennis-court, a barber, or a slave that fills coffee.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Oh! oh!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What art thou? [<i>Kicks him.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, I must not discover myself to Ranger
for a kick or two. Oh, pray hold, sir: by that you will
know me. [<i>Delivers him a letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> How, Sir Simon!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Mum, mum, make no excuses, man; I would
not Ranger should have known me for five hundred&mdash;kicks.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Your disguise is so natural, I protest, it will
excuse me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I know that, prithee make no excuses, I say.
No ceremony between thee and I, man:&mdash;read the letter.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What, you have not opened it!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Prithee, don't be angry, the seal is a little
cracked: for I could not help kissing Mrs. Martha's
letter. The word is, now or never. Her father she
finds will be abroad all this day, and she longs to see
your friend Sir Simon Addleplot:&mdash;faith 'tis a pretty
jest; while I am with her, and praising myself to her at
no ordinary rate. Let thee and I alone at an intrigue.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Tell her I will not fail to meet her at the place
and time. Have a care of your charge; and manage
your business like yourself, for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> The gaining Gripe's daughter will make me
support the loss of this young jilt here. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Coming forward.</i>] What fellow's that?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A servant to a friend of mine.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Methinks he something resembles our acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Sir Simon; but it is no compliment to tell him so:
for that knight is the most egregious coxcomb that ever
played with lady's fan.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> So! thanks to my disguise, I know my
enemies! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> The most incorrigible ass, beyond the reproof of
a kicking rival or a frowning mistress. But, if it be
possible, thou dost use him worse than his mistress or
rival can; thou dost make such a cully of him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Does he think so too? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Go, friend, go about your business.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Sir
<span class="smcap">Simon</span>.] A pox! you would spoil all, just in the critical
time of projection. He brings me here a summons from
his mistress, to meet her in the evening; will you come
to my wedding?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Don't speak so loud, you'll break poor Lucy's
heart. Poor creature, she cannot leave you; and, rather
than leave her, you would leave writing of lampoons or
sonnets&mdash;almost.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come, let her go, ungrateful baggage!&mdash;But now
you talk of sonnets, I am no living wit if her love has not
cost me two thousand couplets at least.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But what would you give, now, for a new satire
against women, ready made?&mdash;'Twould be as convenient
to buy satires against women ready made, as it is to buy
cravats ready tied.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Or as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Hey, come away, come away, Mr., or as&mdash;[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Peace, plenty, and pastime be within these
walls!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> 'Tis a small house, you see, and mean
furniture; for no gallants are suffered to come hither.
She might have had ere now as good lodgings as any in
town; her Mortlake<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> hangings, great glasses, cabinets,
china, embroidered beds, Persia carpets, gold-plate, and
the like, if she would have put herself forward. But
your worship may please to make 'em remove to a place
fit to receive one of your worship's quality; for this is a
little scandalous, in truly.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, no; I like it well enough:&mdash;I am not
dainty. Besides, privacy, privacy, Mrs. Joyner! I love
privacy in opposition to the wicked, who hate it.
[<i>Looks about.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What do you look for, sir?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Walls have ears; but, besides, I look for a
private place to retire to, in time of need. Oh! here's
one convenient.
[<i>Turns up a hanging, and discovers the slender
provisions of the family.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But you see, poor innocent souls, to what
use they put it;&mdash;not to hide gallants.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Temperance is the nurse of chastity.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But your worship may please to mend
their fare; and, when you come, may make them entertain
you better than, you see, they do themselves.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, I am not dainty, as I told you. I abominate
entertainments;&mdash;no entertainments, pray, Mrs.
Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> No! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> There can be no entertainment to me more
luscious and savoury than communion with that little
gentlewoman.&mdash;Will you call her out? I fast till I see
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But, in truly, your worship, we should have
brought a bottle or two of Rhenish and some Naples
biscuit, to have entertained the young gentlewoman.
'Tis the mode for lovers to treat their mistresses.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Modes! I tell you, Mrs. Joyner, I hate modes
and forms.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You must send for something to entertain
her with.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Again entertaining!&mdash;we will be to each other
a feast.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I shall be ashamed, in truly, your worship.&mdash;Besides,
the young gentlewoman will despise you.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I shall content her, I warrant you; leave it to
me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I am sure you will not content
me, if you will not content her; 'tis as impossible for a
man to love and be a miser, as to love and be wise, as
they say.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> While you talk of treats, you starve my eyes;
I long to see the fair one; fetch her hither.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I am ashamed she should find me so
abominable a liar; I have so praised you to her, and,
above all your virtues, your liberality; which is so great
a virtue, that it often excuses youth, beauty, courage,
wit, or anything.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Pish, pish! 'tis the virtue of fools; every fool
can have it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> And will your worship want it, then? I
told her&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Why would you tell her anything of me? you
know I am a modest man. But come, if you will have
me as extravagant as the wicked, take that and fetch us
a treat, as you call it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Upon my life a groat! what will this purchase?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Two black pots of ale and a cake, at the cellar.&mdash;Come,
the wine has arsenic in't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, I am mistaken, and my hopes
are abused: I never knew any man so mortified a miser,
that he would deny his lechery anything; I must be even
with thee then another way. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> These useful old women are more exorbitant
and craving in their desires than the young ones in theirs.
These prodigals in white perukes spoil 'em both; and
that's the reason, when the squires come under my
clutches, I make 'em pay for their folly and mine, and
'tis but conscience:&mdash;oh, here comes the fair one at
last!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span> <i>leading in</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <i>who hangs backwards
as she enters.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh Lord, there's a man, godmother!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Come in, child, thou art so bashful&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> My mother is from home too, I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> If she were here, she'd teach you better
manners.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I'm afraid she'd be angry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> To see you so much an ass.&mdash;Come along,
I say.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Nay, speak to her gently; if you won't, I will.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Pretty innocent! there is, I see, one left of her
age; what hap have I! Sweet little gentlewoman, come
sit down by me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I am better bred, I hope, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You must sit down by me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I'd rather stand, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> To please me, you must sit, sweetest.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Not before my godmother, sure.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Wonderment of innocence!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> A poor bashful girl, sir: I'm sorry she is
not better taught.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I am glad she is not taught; I'll teach her
myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Are you a dancing-master then, sir? But if I
should be dull, and not move as you would have me, you
would not beat me, sir, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Beat thee, honeysuckle! I'll use thee thus,
and thus, and thus. [<i>Kisses her.</i>] Ah, Mrs. Joyner,
prithee go fetch our treat now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> A treat of a groat! I will not wag.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Why don't you go? Here, take more money,
and fetch what you will; take here, half-a-crown.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What will half-a-crown do?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Take a crown then, an angel, a piece;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;begone!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> A treat only will not serve my turn; I
must buy the poor wretch there some toys.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> What toys? what? speak quickly.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Pendants, necklaces, fans, ribbons, points,
laces, stockings, gloves&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Hold, hold! before it comes to a gown.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Well remembered, sir; indeed she wants a
gown, for she has but that one to her back. For your
own sake you should give her a new gown, for variety of
dresses rouses desire, and makes an old mistress seem
every day a new one.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> For that reason she shall have no new gown;
for I am naturally constant, and as I am still the same, I
love she should be still the same. But here, take half a
piece for the other things.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Half a piece!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Prithee, begone!&mdash;take t'other piece then&mdash;two
pieces&mdash;three pieces&mdash;five! here, 'tis all I have.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I must have the broad-seal ring too, or I
stir not.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Insatiable woman! will you have that too!
Prithee spare me that, 'twas my grandfather's.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> That's false, he had ne'er a coat.&mdash;So! now
I go; this is but a violent fit, and will not hold. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! whither do you go, godmother? will you
leave me alone?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> The gentleman will not hurt you; you
may venture yourself with him alone.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I think I may, godmother.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.] What! will you lock me in, sir? don't lock
me in, sir. [<span class="smcap">Gripe</span>, <i>fumbling at the door, locks it.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> 'Tis a private lesson, I must teach you, fair.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I don't see your fiddle, sir; where is your little
kit?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I'll show it thee presently, sweetest.&mdash;[<i>Sets a

my dearest. [<i>Takes her in his arms.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What do you mean, sir? don't hurt me, sir,

you old goat? ravished my daughter!&mdash;ravished my
daughter! speak, villain.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> By yea and by nay, no such matter.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> A canting rogue, too! Take notice, landlord,
he has ravished my daughter, you see her
all in tears and distraction; and see there the wicked
engine of the filthy execution.&mdash;[<i>Pointing to the chair.</i>]&mdash;Jeremy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Go, go, make haste&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! oh!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Poor wretch!&mdash;Go quickly.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Hold! hold!&mdash;Thou young spawn of the old
serpent! wicked, as I thought thee innocent! wilt thou
say I would have ravished thee?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I will swear you did ravish me.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I thought so, treacherous Eve!&mdash;then I am
gone, I must shift as well as I can.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! oh!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Will none of you call up the neighbours,
and the authority of the alley?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Hold, I'll give you twenty mark<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> among you

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh! oh!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Come, sir, I am your friend:&mdash;in a word, I
have appeased her, and she shall be contented with a
little sum.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> What is it? what is it?</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> But five hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> But five hundred pounds!&mdash;hang me then,
hang me rather.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> You will say I have been your friend.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> How, how; will you not take a hundred?
pray use conscience in your ways.
[<i>Kneels to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> I scorn your money! I will not take a
thousand.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] My enemies are many, and I shall be
a scandal to the faithful, as a laughing-stock to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
wicked.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Go, prepare your engines for my
persecution; I'll give you the best security I can.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> The instruments are drawing in the other room,
if you please to go thither.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Indeed, now I consider, a portion will do
my daughter more good than his death. That would but
publish her shame; money will cover it&mdash;<i>probatum est</i>, as
they say. Let me tell you, sir, 'tis a charitable thing to
give a young maid a portion. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lydia's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>, <i>attended by</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> 'Tis as hard for a woman to conceal her indignation
from her apostate lover, as to conceal her love
from her faithful servant.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Or almost as hard as it is for the prating
fellows now-a-days to conceal the favours of obliging
ladies.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> If Ranger should come up, (I saw him just now
in the street,) the discovery of my anger to him now
would be as mean as the discovery of my love to him
before.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Though I did so mean a thing as to love a
fellow, I would not do so mean a thing as to confess it,
certainly, by my trouble to part with him. If I confessed
love, it should be before they left me.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> So you would deserve to be left, before you
were. But could you ever do so mean a thing as to
confess love to any?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Yes; but I never did so mean a thing as
really to love any.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> You had once a husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Fy! madam, do you think me so ill bred as
to love a husband?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> You had a widow's heart, before you were a
widow, I see.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I should rather make an adventure of my
honour with a gallant for a gown, a new coach, a necklace,
than clap my husband's cheeks for them, or sit in
his lap. I should be as ashamed to be caught in such a
posture with a husband, as a brisk well-bred spark of
the town would be to be caught on his knees at prayers&mdash;unless
to his mistress.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Mr. Ranger, 'twas obligingly done of you.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Indeed, cousin, I had kept my promise with you
last night, but this gentleman knows&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> You mistake me; but you shall not lessen any
favour you do to me. You are going to excuse your not
coming to me last night, when I take it as a particular
obligation, that though you threatened me with a visit,
upon consideration you were so civil as not to trouble
me.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> This is an unlucky morning with me! here's my
eternal persecution, the widow Flippant. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> What, Mr. Dapperwit!
[<span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span> <i>retires to the back of the stage,
followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Indeed, cousin, besides my business, another
cause I did not wait on you was, my apprehension you
were gone to the Park, notwithstanding your promise to
the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Therefore, you went to the Park to visit me
there, notwithstanding your promise to the contrary?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Who, I at the Park! when I had promised to
wait upon you at your lodging! But were you at the
Park, madam?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Who, I at the Park! when I had promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
wait for you at home! I was no more at the Park than
you were. Were you at the Park?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> The Park had been a dismal desert to me, notwithstanding
all the good company in it, if I had wanted
yours.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Because it has been the constant endeavour
of men to keep women ignorant, they think us
so; but 'tis that increases our inquisitiveness, and makes
us know them ignorant as false. He is as impudent a
dissembler as the widow Flippant, who is making her
importunate addresses in vain, for aught I see.</p>

<p class="center">[Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>comes forward, driving</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>
<i>from one side of the stage to the other.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Dear Mr. Dapperwit! merciful Mr. Dapperwit!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Unmerciful Lady Flippant!</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will you be satisfied?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Won't you be satisfied?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> That a wit should be jealous; that a wit
should be jealous! there's never a brisk young fellow in
the town, though no wit, Heaven knows, but thinks too
well of himself, to think ill of his wife or mistress. Now,
that a wit should lessen his opinion of himself;&mdash;for
shame!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I promised to bring you off, but I find it enough
to shift for myself&mdash;[<i>Softly, apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> What! out of breath, madam!</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I have been defending our cause, madam;
I have beat him out of the pit. I do so mumble these
prating, censorious fellows they call wits, when I meet
with them.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Her ladyship, indeed, is the only thing in petticoats
I dread. 'Twas well for me there was company in
the room; for I dare no more venture myself with her
alone, than a cully that has been bit dares venture himself
in a tavern with an old rook.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I am the revenger of our sex, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And the most insatiable one I ever knew,
madam; I dare not stand your fury longer.&mdash;Mr.
Ranger, I will go before and make a new appointment
with your friends that expect you at dinner at the
French-house; 'tis fit business still wait on love.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Do so&mdash;but now I think on't, Sir Thomas goes
out of town this afternoon, and I shall not see him here
again these three months.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Nay, pray take him with you, sir.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> No, sir, you shall not take the gentleman
from his mistress.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.] Do not go
yet, sweet Mr. Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Take him with you, sir; I suppose his business
may be there to borrow or win money, and I ought not
to be his hindrance: for when he has none, he has his
desperate designs upon that little I have;&mdash;for want of
money makes as devout lovers as Christians.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I hope, madam, he offers you no less security
than his liberty.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> His liberty is as poor a pawn to take up money
on as honour. He is like the desperate bankrupts of
this age, who, if they can get people's fortunes into their
hands, care not though they spend them in jail all their
lives.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> And the poor crediting ladies, when they have
parted with their money, must be contented with a
pitiful composition, or starve, for all them.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But widows are commonly so wise as to be sure
their men are solvable before they trust 'em.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Can you blame 'em! I declare I will trust
no man. Pray, do not take it ill, gentlemen: quacks in
their bills, and poets in the titles of their plays, do not
more disappoint us, than gallants with their promises;
but I trust none.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Nay, she's a very Jew in that particular. To
my knowledge, she'll know her man, over and over
again, before she trust him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Well, my dearest cousin, good-morrow. When
I stay from you so long again, blame me to purpose,
and be extremely angry; for nothing can make me
amends for the loss of your company, but your reprehension
of my absence. I'll take such a chiding as
kindly as Russian wives do beating.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> If you were my husband, I could not take your
absence more kindly than I do.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> And if you were my wife, I would trust you as
much out of my sight as I could, to show my opinion of
your virtue.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> A well-bred gentleman, I warrant.&mdash;Will you
go then, cruel Mr. Dapperwit?
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>, <i>followed by</i>
Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Have I not dissembled well, Leonore?</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> But, madam, to what purpose? why do you not
put him to his trial, and see what he can say for himself?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I am afraid lest my proofs, and his guilt, should
make him desperate, and so contemn that pardon which
he could not hope for.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> 'Tis unjust to condemn him before you hear him.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I will reprieve him till I have more evidence.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> How will you get it?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I will write him a letter in Christina's name,
desiring to meet him; when I shall soon discover if his
love to her be of a longer standing than since last night;
and if it be not, I will not longer trust him with the
vanity to think she gave him the occasion to follow her
home from the Park; so will at once disabuse him and
myself.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> What care the jealous take in making sure of ills
which they, but in imagination, cannot undergo!</p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>, <i>the latter in a blue gown
and nightcap.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What, not well, your worship!
This it is, you will be laying out yourself
beyond your strength. You have
taken a surfeit of the little gentlewoman,
I find. Indeed you should not have been
so immoderate in your embraces; your worship is something
in years, in truly.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Graceless, perfidious woman! what makest
thou here? art thou not afraid to be used like an
informer, since thou hast made me pay thee for
betraying me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Betray your worship! what do you mean?
I an informer! I scorn your words!</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Woman, I say again, thou art as treacherous as
an informer, and more unreasonable; for he lets us have
something for our money before he disturb us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Your money, I'm sure, was laid out
faithfully; and I went away because I would not
disturb you.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I had not grudged you the money I gave
you:&mdash;but the five hundred pounds! the five hundred
pounds! Inconscionable, false woman, the five hundred
pounds!&mdash;You cheated, trepanned, robbed me, of the
five hundred pounds!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I cheat you! I rob you!&mdash;well, remember
what you say, you shall answer it before Mr. Doublecap
and the best of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Oh, impudent woman, speak softly!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I will not speak softly; for innocence is
loud as well as barefaced. Is this your return, after you
have made me a mere drudge to your filthy lusts?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Speak softly; my sister, daughter, and servants,
will hear.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I would have witnesses, to take notice that
you blast my good name, which was as white as a tulip,
and as sweet as the head of your cane, before you
wrought me to the carrying on the work of your fleshly
carnal seekings.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Softly! softly! they are coming in.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> What's the matter, brother?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Nothing, nothing, sister, only the godly woman
is fallen into a fit of zeal against the enormous transgressions
of the age. Go! go! you do not love to hear
vanity reproved; pray begone!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Pray stay, madam, that you may know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.] Hold! hold! here are
five guineas for thee,&mdash;pray say nothing.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Sister,
pray begone, I say.&mdash;[<i>Exeunt</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>and</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>.] Would you prejudice your own reputation
to injure mine?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Would you prejudice your own soul to
wrong my repute, in truly? [<i>Pretends to weep.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Pray have me in excuse. Indeed, I thought
you had a share of the five hundred pounds, because you
took away my seal-ring; which they made me send,
together with a note to my cash-keeper for five hundred
pounds. Besides, I thought none but you knew it was
my wonted token to send for money by.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> 'Tis unlucky I should forget it, and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
it on the table!&mdash;But oh the harlotry! did she make that
use of it then? 'twas no wonder you did not stay till I
came back.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I stayed till the money released me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Have they the money, then? five hundred
pounds!</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Too certain.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> They told me not a word of it; and have
you no way to retrieve it?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Not any.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I am glad of it.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Is there
no law but against saints?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I will not for five hundred pounds publish my
transgression myself, lest I should be thought to glory
in't: though, I must confess, 'twould tempt a man to
conform to public praying and sinning, since 'tis so
chargeable to pray and sin in private.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But are you resolved to give off a loser?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> How shall I help it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Nay, I'll see you shall have what the young
jade has, for your money; I'll make 'em use some
conscience, however.&mdash;Take a man's money for nothing!</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Thou sayest honestly, indeed. And shall I
have my pennyworths out of the little gentlewoman for
all this?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I'll be engaged body for body for her, and
you shall take the forfeiture on me else.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, no, I'll rather take your word, Mrs.
Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Go in and dress yourself smug, and leave
the rest to me.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No man breathing would give-off a loser, as she
says. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Another Room in the same.</i></h4>

<p class="center">Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span> <i>discovered sitting at a desk
writing as a</i> Clerk, Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>jogging him.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> 'Tis a lord's mortgage, and therefore requires
the more haste:&mdash;pray do not jog me, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Dull rascal! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> They cannot stay for money as other folks.
If you will not let me make an end on't, I shall lose my
expedition-fee.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> There are some clerks would have understood
me before this. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, pray be quiet, madam; if you squeeze
me so to the wall, I cannot write.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] 'Tis much for the honour of the
gentlemen of this age, that we persons of quality are
forced to descend to the importuning of a clerk, a butler,
coachman, or footman; while the rogues are as dull of
apprehension, too, as an unfledged country squire amongst
his mother's maids! [<i>Jogs him again.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Again! Let me tell you, madam, familiarity
breeds contempt: you'll never leave till you have made
me saucy.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I would I could see that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I vow and swear then, get you gone! or I'll
add a black patch or two to those on your face.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I shall have no time to get Mrs. Martha out, for her.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Will you, sir, will you! [<i>Jogs him again.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I must have a plot for her, she is a
coy woman.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] I vow and swear if you pass this
crevice,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> I'll kiss you in plain English.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I would I could see that!&mdash;do you defy me!
[<i>Steps to him&mdash;he kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How's this! I vow and swear, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
kisses as tamely as Mrs. Ticklish, and with her mouth
open too.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I thought you would have been ashamed to
have done so to your master's own sister!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I hope you'll be quiet now, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Nay, I'll be revenged of you sure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> If you come again, I shall do more to you
than that.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I'll pursue my plot and try if she be
honest.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> You do more to me than that! nay, if you'll
do more to me than that&mdash;[<i>She
throws down his ink and runs out, he following her.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I must visit my young clients in the meantime.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon</span>, <i>holding up his hands.</i></p>

<p>What's the matter, Sir Simon?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Lord! who would have thought it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What ails you, Sir Simon?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I have made such a discovery, Mrs. Joyner!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> What is't?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Such a one that makes me at once glad and
sorry; I am sorry my Lady Flippant is naught, but I'm
glad I know it:&mdash;thanks still to my disguise.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Fy! fy!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, this hand can tell&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> But how?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> She threw down my ink-glass, and ran away
into the next room; I followed her, and, in revenge,
threw her down upon the bed:&mdash;but, in short, all that I
could do to her would not make her squeak.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> She was out of breath, man, she was out of
breath.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Ah, Mrs. Joyner, say no more, say no more
of that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> You rude, unmannerly rascal!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You see she complains now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I know why, Mrs. Joyner, I know why.
[<i>Aside to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I'll have you turned out of the house; you are
not fit for my brother's service.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Not for yours, you mean, madam. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I'll go and acquaint my brother&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.] Hold, hold,
madam, speak not so loud:&mdash;'tis Sir Simon Addleplot,
your lover, who has taken this disguise on purpose to be
near you, and to watch and supplant his rival.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> What a beast was I, I could not discover it!
you have undone me! why would you not tell me sooner
of it? [<i>Aside to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I thought he had been discernible enough.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> I protest, I knew him not; for I must confess
to you, my eyes are none of the best since I have used
the last new wash of mercury-water.&mdash;What will he think
of me!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Let me alone with him.&mdash;[<i>To</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon</span>.]
Come, come, did you think you could disguise yourself
from my lady's knowledge? she knew you, man, or else
you had ne'er had those liberties. Alas, poor lady, she
cannot resist you!</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> 'Tis my weakness.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> How's this!&mdash;but here comes my master.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Come, Mrs. Joyner, are you ready to go?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I am ever ready when your worship
commands.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Brother, if you go to t'other end of the town,
you'll set me down near the playhouse?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> The playhouse! do you think I will be seen
near the playhouse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> You shall set me down in Lincoln's-inn-fields,
then? for I have earnest business there.&mdash;[<i>Apart to</i> Sir
<span class="smcap">Simon</span>.] When I come home again, I'll laugh at you
soundly, Sir Simon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Has Joyner betrayed me then! 'tis time to
look to my hits. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Martha, be sure you stay within now. If you
go out, you shall never come into my doors again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> No, I will not, sir; I'll ne'er come into
your doors again, if once I should go out.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> 'Tis well said, girl.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>, <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> 'Twas prettily said: I understand you, they
are dull, and have no intrigue in 'em. But dear sweet
Mrs. Martha, 'tis time we were gone; you have stole
away your scarfs and hood from your maid, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Nay, I am ready, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Come, come, Sir Simon Addleplot, poor
gentleman, is an impatient man, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Well, my venture is great, I'm sure, for a
man I know not. But pray, Jonas, do not deceive me;
is he so fine a gentleman, as you say he is?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Pish! pish! he is the&mdash;gentleman of the
town, faith and troth.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> But may I take your word, Jonas?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> 'Tis not my word, 'tis the word of all the
town.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Excuse me, Jonas, for that:&mdash;I never heard
any speak well of him but Mr. Dapperwit and you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> That's because he has been a rival to all
men, and a gallant to all ladies. Rivals and deserted
mistresses never speak well of a man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Has he been so general in his amours? his
kindness is not to be valued then.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> The more by you; because 'tis for you he
deserts all the rest, faith and troth.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You plead better for him than he could for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
himself, I believe; for, indeed, they say he is no better
than an idiot.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Then, believe me, madam&mdash;for nobody knows
him better than I&mdash;he has as much wit, courage, and as
good a mien to the full, as I have.&mdash;He an idiot!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> The common gull; so perspicuous a fop, the
women find him out:&mdash;for none of 'em will marry him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> You may see, now, how he and you are
abused. For that he is not married, is a sign of his wit;
and for being perspicuous, 'tis false; he is as mysterious
as a new parliament-man, or a young statesman newly
taken from a coffee-house or tennis-court.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> But is it a sign of his wit because he is
not married?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Yes, yes; your women of the town ravish
your fops: there's not one about the town unmarried that
has anything.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> It may be then he has spent his estate.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How unluckily guessed!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
If he had, he has a head can retrieve it again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Besides, they say he has the modish distemper.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> He can cure it with the best French chirurgeon
in town.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Has his practice on himself been so much?</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Come, come.&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who doubts her man, must be advised by Hymen;</span><br />

<p><i>Ran.</i> Now the Lucys have renounced us, hey for the
Christinas! She cannot use me worse than your honourable
mistress did you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! some young heir or another has promised
her marriage. There are so many fools in the
world, 'tis impossible for a man of wit to keep his wench
from being a lady, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But have you no other acquaintance that sticks
to her vocation, in spite of temptations of honour or
filthy lucre? I declare, I make honourable love merely
out of necessity, as your rooks play on the square rather
than not play at all.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span> <i>masked, with a letter in her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come, the devil will not lose a gamester: here's
ready money for you, push freely.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Thou art as well met as if by assignation.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> And you are as well met as if you were the man
I looked for.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Kind rogue!</p>

show but thy warrant. [<i>Goes to pull off her mask.</i></p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> You mistake, sir; here is my pass.
[<i>Gives him the letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> A letter! and directed to me!</p>

<p>[<i>Reads.</i>] "I cannot put up the injuries and affronts
you did me last night;"&mdash;a challenge, upon my life!
and by such a messenger!&mdash;"therefore conjure you by
your honour, at eight o'clock precisely, this evening, to
send your man to St. James's gate, to wait for me with a
chair, to conduct me to what place you shall think
most fit, for the giving of satisfaction to the injured&mdash;Christina."</p>

<p>Christina! I am amazed! What is it o'clock, Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> It wants not half an hour of eight.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.] Go then back, my pretty
herald, and tell my fair enemy the service she designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
my man is only fit for my friend here; whose faith and
honour she may be secure of. He shall immediately go
wait for her at St James's gate, whilst I go to prepare a
place for our rencounter, and myself to die at her feet.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.] Dapperwit, dear Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What lucky surprisal's this?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Prithee ask no questions, till I have more leisure
and less astonishment. I know you will not deny to be
an instrument in my happiness.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> No, let me perish! I take as much pleasure to
bring lovers together as an old woman; or as a bankrupt
gamester loves to look on, though he has no advantage
by the play; or as a bully that fights not himself, yet
takes pleasure to set people together by the ears, or as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> 'Sdeath! is this a time for similitudes?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You have made me miscarry of a good thought
now, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Go presently to St. James's gate, where you are
to expect the coming of a lady ('tis Christina), accompanied
by that woman you saw e'en now. She will
permit you to put her into a chair, and then conduct her
to my lodging; while I go before to remove some spies,
and prepare it for her reception.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Your lodging? had you not better carry her to
Vincent's? 'tis hard by; and there a vizard mask has as
free egress and regress as at the playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Faith, though it be not very prudent, yet she
shall come thither in my vindication; for he would not
believe I had seen her last night.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> To have a fine woman, and not tell on't as you
say, Mr. Ranger&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Go, and bring her to Vincent's lodging; there
I'll expect you. [<i>Exeunt severally.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> 'Tis no matter, we will pass it by; lest the
people of our lodgings should watch us. But if he
should not be here now!</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Who, Mr. Valentine, madam? I warrant you
my intelligencer dares not fail me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Did he come last night, said he?</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Last night late.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> And not see me yet! nay, not send to me!&mdash;'tis
false, he is not come,&mdash;I wish he were not. I know
not which I should take more unkindly from him, exposing
his life to his revengeful enemies, or being almost
four-and-twenty hours so near me, and not let me
know't.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> A lover's dangers are the only secrets kept from
his mistress; he came not to you because he would not
purchase his happiness with your fear and apprehensions.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Nay, he is come, I see, since you are come
about again of his side.</p>

<p><i>Isa.</i> Will you go in, madam, and disprove me, if you
can? 'tis better than standing in the street.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I told you I had sent my man to Christina's this
morning, to inquire of her maid, (who seldom denies him
a secret,) if her lady had been at the Park last night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
which she peremptorily answered to the contrary, and
assured him she had not stirred out since your departure.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Will not chambermaids lie, Vincent?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Will not Ranger lie, Valentine?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> The circumstances of his story proved it true.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Do you think so old a master in the faculty as
he will want the varnish of probability for his lies?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Do you think a woman, having the advantage of
her sex, and education under such a mistress, will want
impudence to disavow a truth that might be prejudicial
to that mistress?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But if both testimonies are fallible, why will you
needs believe his? we are apter to believe the things we
would have, than those we would not.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> My ill luck has taught me to credit my misfortunes
and doubt my happiness.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But fortune we know is inconstant.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> And all of her sex.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Will you judge of fortune by your experience,
and not do your mistress the same justice? Go see her,
and satisfy yourself and her; for if she be innocent, consider
how culpable you are, not only in your censures of
her, but in not seeing her since your coming.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> If she be innocent, I should be afraid to surprise
her, for her sake; if false, I should be afraid to surprise
her for my own.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> To be jealous and not inquisitive is as hard as to
love extremely and not to be something jealous.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Inquisitiveness as seldom cures jealousy, as
drinking in a fever quenches the thirst.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> If she were at the Park last night, 'tis probable
she'll not miss this. Go watch her house, see who goes
out, who in; while I, in the meantime, search out
Ranger: who, I'll pawn my life, upon more discourse
shall avow his mistake.&mdash;Here he is; go in:&mdash;how
luckily is he come!

<p>Ranger, you have prevented me: I was going to look
you out, between the scenes at the playhouse, the coffee-house,
tennis-court, or Gifford's.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Do you want a pretence to go to a bawdy-house?&mdash;but
I have other visits to make.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I forget. I should rather have sought you in
Christina's lodgings, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Well, well, I'm just come to tell you that
Christina&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Proves not, by daylight, the kind lady you
followed last night out of the Park.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I have better news for you, to my thinking.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What is't?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Not that I have been in Christina's lodging
this morning; but that she'll be presently here in your
lodging with me.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin. [Retiring, and speaking softly to</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.]
You see now, his report was a jest, a mere jest.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.] Well, must my lodging be your vaulting-school<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
still? thou hast appointed a wench to come
hither, I find.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> A wench! you seemed to have more reverence
for Christina last night.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Now you talk of Christina, prithee tell me what
was the meaning of thy last night's romance of Christina?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You shall know the meaning of all when Christina
comes: she'll be here presently.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Who will? Christina?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Yes, Christina.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Incredulous envy! thou art as envious as an
impotent lecher at a wedding.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Thou art either mad, or as vain as a Frenchman
newly returned home from a campaign, or obliging
England.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Thou art as envious as a rival; but if thou art
mine, there's that will make you desist; [<i>gives him a
letter</i>] and if you are not my rival, entrusting you with
such a secret will, I know, oblige you to keep it, and
assist me against all other interests.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Do you think I take your secret as an obligation?
don't I know, lovers, travellers, and poets, will give
money to be heard? But what's the paper? a lampoon
upon Christina, hatched last night betwixt squire Dapperwit
and you, because her maid used you scurvily?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> No, 'tis only a letter from her, to show my company
was not so disgustful to her last night, but that she
desires it again to-day.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> A letter from her! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> A letter from Christina! [<i>Reads.</i>]&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, 'tis pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You mistake, I laugh at you, not the letter.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I am like the winning gamester, so pleased with
my luck, I will not quarrel with any who calls me a fool
for't.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Is this the style of a woman of honour?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> It may be, for ought you know; I'm sure 'tis
well if your female correspondents can read.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I must confess I have none of the little letters,
half name or title, like your Spanish Epistles Dedicatory;
but that a man so frequent in honourable intrigues as
you are, should not know the summons of an impudent
common woman, from that of a person of honour!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Christina is so much a person of honour she'll
own what she has writ when she comes.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But will she come hither indeed?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Immediately. You'll excuse my liberty with you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
I could not conceal such a happiness from such a friend
as you, lest you should have taken it unkindly.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Faith, you have obliged me indeed; for you and
others would often have made me believe your honourable
intrigues, but never did me the honour to convince
me of 'em before.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You are merry, I find, yet.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> When you are happy I cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] But I lose time; I should lay a little
parson in ambush, that lives hard by, in case Christina
should be impatient to be revenged of her friends, as it
often happens with a discontented heiress. Women,
like old soldiers, more nimbly execute than they resolve.
[<i>Going out.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What now! you will not disappoint a woman of
Christina's quality?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I'll be here before she comes, I warrant you.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I do believe you truly!&mdash;What think you,
Valentine?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> [<i>Coming forward.</i>] I think, since she has the
courage to challenge him, she'll have the honour of being
first in the field.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Fy, your opinion of her must be as bad, as
Ranger's of himself is good, to think she would write to
him. I long till his bona-roba<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> comes, that you may be
both disabused.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> And I have not patience to stay her coming, lest
you should be disabused.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Here she is, i'faith; I'm glad she's come.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> And I'm sorry. But I will to my post again, lest
she should say she came to me. [<i>Retires as before.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] By heavens, Christina herself! 'tis she!
[<span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>pulls off her mask.</i></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> 'Tis she:&mdash;cursed be these eyes! more cursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
than when they first betrayed me to that false bewitching
face. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> You may wonder, sir, to see me here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I must confess I do.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> But the confidence your friend has in you is the
cause of mine; and yet some blushes it does cost me to
come to seek a man.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Modest creature! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> How am I deceived! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Where is he, sir? why does he not appear, to
keep me in countenance? pray call him, sir; 'tis something
hard if he should know I'm here.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I hardly can myself believe you are here,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> If my visit be troublesome or unseasonable, 'tis
your friend's fault; I designed it not to you, sir. Pray
call him out, that he may excuse it, and take it on himself,
together with my shame.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> How impatient she is! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Or do you delay the happiness I ask, to make
it more welcome? I have stayed too long for it already,
and cannot more desire it. Dear sir, call him out.
Where is he? above, or here within? I'll snatch the
favour which you will not give.&mdash;[<i>Goes to the door and discovers</i>
<span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.] What! Do you hide yourself for
shame?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> [<i>Coming forward.</i>] I must confess I do.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> To see me come hither&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I acknowledge it. [<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>offers to go out.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Before you came to me? But whither do you
go? come, I can forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> But I cannot forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Whither do you go? you need not forge a
quarrel to prevent mine to you: nor need you try if I
would follow you, you know I will;&mdash;I have, you see.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> That impudence should look so like innocence!
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Whither would you go? why would you go?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> To call your servant to you.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> She is here; what would you have with her?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I mean your lover,&mdash;the man you came to meet.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Oh heavens! what lover? what man? I came
to see no man but you, whom I had too long lost.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> You could not know that I was here.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Ask her; 'twas she that told me.
[<i>Points to</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How could she know?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> That you shall know hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> No, you thought me too far out of the way to
disturb your assignation; and I assure you, madam, 'twas
my ill-fortune, not my design: and that it may appear so,
I do withdraw, as in all good breeding and civility I am
obliged; for sure your wished-for lover's coming.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What do you mean? are you a-weary of that
title?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I am ashamed of it, since it grows common.
[<i>Going out.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Nay, you will not, shall not go.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> My stay might give him jealousy, and so do you
injury, and him the greatest in the world: heavens forbid!
I would not make a man jealous; for though you
call a thousand vows, and oaths, and tears to witness (as
you safely may), that you have not the least of love for
me, yet if he ever knew how I have loved you, sure he
would not, could not believe you.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I do confess, your riddle is too hard for me to
solve; therefore you are obliged to do't yourself.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I wish it were capable of any other interpretation
than what you know already.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Is this that generous good Valentine? who has
disguised him so? [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Nay, I must withhold you then. [<i>Stops</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>
<i>going out.</i>] Methinks she should be innocent; her
tongue, and eyes, together with that flood that swells 'em,
do vindicate her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> They show but their long practice of dissimulation.
[<i>Going out.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Come back: I hear Ranger coming up: stay but
till he comes.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Do you think I have the patience of an alderman?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You may go out this way, when you will, by the
back-stairs; but stay a little, till&mdash;Oh, here he comes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>. <i>Upon his entrance</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span>
<i>puts on her mask.</i></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> My revenge will now detain me.
[<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>retires again.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;What, come already! where is
Dapperwit?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] The blessing's double that comes quickly;
I did not yet expect you here, otherwise I had not done
myself the injury to be absent. But I hope, madam, I
have not made you stay long for me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I have not staid at all for you.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I am glad of it, madam.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.] Is not this that troublesome
stranger who last night followed the lady into my
lodgings?&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] 'Tis he.
[<i>Removing from him to the other side.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Why does she remove so disdainfully
from me?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] I find you take it ill I was not at
your coming here, madam.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Indeed I do not; you are mistaken, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Confirm me by a smile then, madam; remove
that cloud, which makes me apprehend foul weather.
[<i>Goes to take off her mask.</i>]&mdash;Mr. Vincent, pray retire;
'tis you keep on the lady's mask, and no displeasure
which she has for me.&mdash;Yet, madam, you need not distrust
his honour or his faith.&mdash;But do not keep the lady
under constraint; pray leave us a little, Master Vincent.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> You must not leave us, sir; would you leave
me with a stranger?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How's that! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I've done amiss, I find, to bring her
hither.&mdash;Madam, I understand you&mdash;[<i>Apart
to</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span>.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Sir, I do not understand you.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You would not be known to Mr. Vincent.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> 'Tis your acquaintance I would avoid.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Dull brute that I was, to bring her
hither!&mdash;I have found my error, madam; give me but a
new appointment, where I may meet you by and by, and
straight I will withdraw as if I knew you not. [<i>Softly to her.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Why, do you know me?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I must not own it.&mdash;No, madam, but&mdash;[<i>Offers
to whisper.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Whispering, sir, argues an old acquaintance;
but I have not the vanity to be thought of yours, and resolve
you shall never have the disparagement of mine.&mdash;Mr.
Vincent, pray let us go in here.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> How's this! I am undone, I see; but if I let her
go thus, I shall be an eternal laughing-stock to Vincent.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Do you not know him, madam? I thought you
had come hither on purpose to meet him.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> To meet him!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> By your own appointment.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> What strange infatuation does delude you all?
you know, he said he did not know me.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You writ to him; he has your letter.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Then, you know my name sure? yet you confessed
but now you knew me not.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I must confess your anger has disguised you
more than your mask: for I thought to have met a
kinder Christina here.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Heavens! how could he know me in
this place? he watched me hither sure; or is there any
other of my name.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] That you may no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mistake me for your Christina, I'll pull off that which
soothes your error. [<i>Pulls off her mask.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Take but t'other vizard off too, (I mean your
anger,) and I'll swear you are the same, and only Christina
which I wished, and thought, to meet here.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> How could you think to meet me here?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Gives her the letter.</i>] By virtue of this your commission;
which now, I see, was meant a real challenge:
for you look as if you would fight with me.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> The paper is a stranger to me; I never writ it.
You are abused.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Christina is a person of honour, and will own
what she has written, Ranger.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So! the comedy begins; I shall be
laughed at sufficiently if I do not justify myself; I must
set my impudence to hers. She is resolved to deny all,
I see, and I have lost all hope of her.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Come, faith, Ranger&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You will deny too, madam, that I followed you
last night from the Park to your lodging, where I staid
with you till morning? you never saw me before, I
warrant.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> That you rudely intruded last night into my
lodging, I cannot deny; but I wonder you have the
confidence to brag of it: sure you will not of your
reception?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I never was so ill-bred as to brag of my reception
in a lady's chamber; not a word of that, madam.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How! If he lies, I revenge her; if it I
be true, I revenge myself.
[<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>draws his sword, which</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>,

to mine, to make me and it ridiculous. 'Tis true,
I find, they have been long acquainted, and I long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
abused; but since she intends a triumph, in spite, as well
as shame, (not emulation,) I retire. She deserves no
envy, who will be shortly in my condition; his natural
inconstancy will prove my best revenge on her&mdash;on both.

<p><i>Dap.</i> Christina's going away again;&mdash;what's the
matter?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I scarce had paid the chairmen, and was coming
up after her, but I met her on the stairs, in as much haste
as if she had been frightened.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Who do you talk of?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Christina, whom I took up in a chair just now at
St. James's gate.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Thou art mad! here she is, this is Christina.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I must confess I did not see her face; but I am
sure the lady is gone that I brought just now.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I tell you again this is she: did you bring two?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I came in no chair, had no guide but my woman
there.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> When did you bring your lady, Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Even now, just now.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> This lady has been here half-an-hour.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> He knows not what he says, he is mad: you are
all so; I am so too.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> 'Tis the best excuse you can make for yourself,
and by owning your mistake you'll show you are come to
yourself. I myself saw your woman at the door, who but
looked in, and then immediately went down again;&mdash;as
your friend Dapperwit too affirms.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> You had best follow her that looked for you;
and I'll go seek out him I came to see.&mdash;Mr. Vincent,
pray let me in here.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> 'Tis very fine! wondrous fine!

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Oh! he is gone! Mr. Vincent, follow him; he
were yet more severe to me in endangering his life, than
in his censures against me. You know the power of his
enemies is great as their malice;&mdash;just Heaven preserve
him from them, and me from this ill or unlucky man!
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Christina, Isabel</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> 'Tis well&mdash;nay, certainly, I shall never be master
of my senses more: but why dost thou help to distract
me too?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> My astonishment was as great as yours to see
her go away again; I would have stayed her if I could.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Yet again talking of a woman you met going
out, when I talk of Christina!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I talk of Christina too.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> She went out just now; the woman you found
me with was she.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> That was not the Christina I brought just now.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You brought her almost half an hour ago;&mdash;'sdeath,
will you give me the lie?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A lady disappointed by her gallant, the night
before her journey, could not be more touchy with her
maid or husband, than you are with me now after your
disappointment; but if you thank me so, I'll go serve
myself hereafter. For aught I know, I have disappointed
Mrs. Martha for you, and may lose thirty thousand
pounds by the bargain. Farewell! a raving lover is fit
for solitude. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Lydia, triumph! I now am thine again. Of
intrigues, honourable or dishonourable, and all sorts of
rambling, I take my leave; when we are giddy, 'tis time
to stand still. Why should we be so fond of the by-paths
of love, where we are still waylaid with surprises, trepans,
dangers, and murdering disappointments?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> My sweet knight, if he will be knight of
mine, must be contented with what he finds, as well as
other knights.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> So smart already, faith and troth!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Dear Mr. Dapperwit I am overjoyed to see
you; but I thank honest Jonas for't.
[<i>She hugs</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How she hugs him!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Poor Mr. Dapperwit, I thought I should
never have seen you again; but I thank honest Jonas
there&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Do not thank me, Mrs. Martha, any more
than I thank you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I would not be ungrateful, Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Then reserve your kindness only for your
worthy, noble, brave, heroic knight, who loves you only,
and only deserves your kindness.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I will show my kindness to my worthy,
brave, heroic knight, in being kind to his friend, his dear
friend, who helped him to me. [<i>Hugs</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span> <i>again.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> But, Mistress Martha, he is not to help him
always; though he helps him to be married, he is not to
help him when he is married.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> What, Mr. Dapperwit, will you love my
worthy knight less after marriage than before? that were
against the custom; for marriage gets a man friends,
instead of losing those he has.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I will ever be his servant and yours, dear
madam; do not doubt me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I do not, sweet dear Mr. Dapperwit; but
I should not have seen you these two days if it had not
been for honest Jonas there&mdash;[<i>She kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.] For shame! though
she be young and foolish, do not you wrong me to my
face.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Would you have me so ill bred as to repulse her
innocent kindness?&mdash;what a thing it is to want wit!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A pox! I must make haste to discover
myself, or I shall discover what I would not discover;
but if I should discover myself in this habit, 'twould not
be to my advantage. But I'll go, put on my own clothes,
and look like a knight.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Well, Mrs. Martha, I'll
go seek out your knight: are you not impatient to see
him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Wives must be obedient; let him take his
own time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Can you trust yourself a turn or two with
Master Dapperwit?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Yes, yes, Jonas&mdash;as long as you will.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] But I would not trust you with him,
if I could help it.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So married wight sees what he dares not blame;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And cannot budge for fear, nor stay for shame. [<i>Exit.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am glad he is gone, that I may laugh. 'Tis
such a miracle of fops, that his conversation should be
pleasant to me, even when it hindered me of yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Indeed, I'm glad he is gone too, as pleasant
as he is.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I know why, I know why, sweet Mrs. Martha.
I warrant you, you had rather have the parson's company
than his?&mdash;now you are out of your father's house, 'tis
time to leave being a hypocrite.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Well, for the jest's sake, to disappoint my
knight, I would not care if I disappointed myself of a
ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Come, I will not keep you on the tenters; I
know you have a mind to make sure of me: I have a
little chaplain (I wish he were a bishop or one of the
friars) to perfect our revenge upon that zealous Jew, your
father.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Do not speak ill of my father; he has been
your friend, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> My friend!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> His hard usage of me conspired with your
good mien and wit, and to avoid slavery unto him, I stoop
to your yoke.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I will be obliged to your father for nothing but a
portion; nor to you for your love; 'twas due to my
merit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You show yourself Sir Simon's original; if
'twere not for that vanity&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I should be no wit&mdash;'tis the badge of my calling;
for you can no more find a man of wit without vanity
than a fine woman without affectation: but let us go
before the knight comes again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Let us go before my father comes; he soon
will have the intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Stay, let me think a little. [<i>Pauses.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> What are you thinking of? you should
have thought before this time, or I should have thought
rather.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Peace! peace!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> What are you thinking of?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am thinking what a wit without vanity is like.
He is like&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You do not think we are in a public place,
and may be surprised and prevented by my father's
scouts!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What! would you have me lose my thought?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You would rather lose your mistress, it
seems.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> He is like&mdash;I think I am a sot to-night, let me
perish.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Nay, if you are so in love with your
thought&mdash;[<i>Offers to go.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Are you so impatient to be my wife?&mdash;He is like&mdash;he
is like&mdash;a picture without shadows, or&mdash;or&mdash;a face
without patches&mdash;or a diamond without a foil. These
are new thoughts now, these are new!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You are wedded already to your thoughts,
I see;&mdash;good night.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Madam, do not take it ill:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For loss of happy thought there's no amends;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For his new jest true wit will lose old friends.</span><br />
</p>

<p>That's new again,&mdash;the thought's new. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Another part of the same.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>, <i>leading</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span> <i>and</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Crossbite</span> <i>following.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Mrs. Joyner, I can conform to this mode of
public walking by moonlight, because one is not known.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, are you ashamed of your company?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, pretty one; because in the dark, or as it
were in the dark, there is no envy nor scandal. I would
neither lose you nor my reputation.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Your reputation! indeed, your worship,
'tis well known there are as grave men as your worship;
nay, men in office too, that adjourn their cares and
businesses, to come and unbend themselves at night
here, with a little vizard-mask.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I do believe it, Mrs. Joyner.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ay, godmother, and carries and treats her at
Mulberry-garden.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Nay, does not only treat her, but gives her
his whole gleaning of that day.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> They may, they may, Mrs. Crossbite; they
take above six in the hundred.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Nay, there are those of so much worth and
honour and love, that they'll take it from their wives and
children to give it to their misses; now your worship has
no wife, and but one child.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Still for my edification! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> That's true, indeed; for I know a great
lady that cannot follow her husband abroad to his haunts,
because her Ferrandine is so ragged and greasy, whilst
his mistress is as fine as fi'pence, in embroidered satins.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Politicly done of him indeed! If the truth
were known, he is a statesman by that, umph&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Truly, your women of quality are very
troublesome to their husbands: I have heard 'em complain,
they will allow them no separate maintenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
though the honourable jilts themselves will not marry
without it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Come, come, mistress; sometimes 'tis the
craft of those gentlemen to complain of their wives'
expenses to excuse their own narrowness to their misses;
but your daughter has a gallant that can make no excuse.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> So, Mrs. Joyner!&mdash;my friend, Mrs. Joyner&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> I hope, indeed, he'll give my daughter no
cause to dun him; for, poor wretch! she is as modest as
her mother.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I profess, I believe it.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> But I have the boldness to ask him for a treat.&mdash;Come,
gallant, we must walk towards the Mulberry-garden.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> So!&mdash;I am afraid, little mistress, the rooms are
all taken up by this time.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Will you shame yourself again?
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> If the rooms be full we'll have an arbour.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> At this time of night!&mdash;besides, the waiters
will ne'er come near you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> They will be observant of good customers, as we
shall be. Come along.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Indeed, and verily, little mistress, I would go,
but that I should be forsworn if I did.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> That's so pitiful an excuse!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> In truth, I have forsworn the place ever since
I was pawned there for a reckoning.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You have broken many an oath for the good old
cause, and will you boggle at one for your poor little
miss? Come along.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span> <i>behind.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Unfortunate lady that I am! I have left the
herd on purpose to be chased, and have wandered this
hour here; but the Park affords not so much as a satyr
for me, and (that's strange!) no Burgundy man or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
drunken scourer will reel my way. The rag-women, and
cinder-women, have better luck than I.&mdash;But who are
these? if this mongrel light does not deceive me, 'tis my
brother,&mdash;'tis he:&mdash;there's Joyner, too, and two other
women. I'll follow 'em. It must be he, for this world
hath nothing like him;&mdash;I know not what the devil may
be in the other. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Another part of the same.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot</span>, <i>in fine clothes</i>, <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>
<i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>, <i>unseen by him at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Well, after all my seeking, I can find those I
would not find; I'm sure 'twas old Gripe, and Joyner
with him, and the widow followed. He would not have
been here, but to have sought his daughter, sure; but
vigilant Dapperwit has spied them too, and has, no doubt,
secured her from him.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> And you. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> The rogue is as good at hiding, as I am at
stealing, a mistress. 'Tis a vain, conceited fellow, yet I
think 'tis an honest fellow:&mdash;but, again, he is a damnable
whoring fellow; and what opportunity this air and darkness
may incline 'em to, Heaven knows; for I have heard
the rogue say himself, a lady will no more show her
modesty in the dark than a Spaniard his courage.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, if you are there, my true friend, I'll
forgive your hearkening, if you'll forgive my censures.&mdash;I
speak to you, dear Madam Martha; dear, dear&mdash;behold
your worthy knight&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> That's far from neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Is come to reap the fruit of his labours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I cannot see the knight; well, but I'm
sure I hear Jonas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I am no Jonas, Mrs. Martha.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> The night is not so dark, nor the peruke
so big, but I can discern Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Faith and troth, I am the very Sir Simon
Addleplot that is to marry you; the same Dapperwit
solicited you for; ask him else, my name is not Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You think my youth and simplicity capable
of this cheat; but let me tell you, Jonas, 'tis not your
borrowed clothes and titles shall make me marry my
father's man.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Borrowed title! I'll be sworn I bought it of
my laundress, who was a court-laundress; but, indeed,
my clothes I have not paid for; therefore, in that sense,
they are borrowed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Prithee, Jonas, let the jest end, or I shall
be presently in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Pray, be in earnest, and let us go; the parson
and supper stay for us, and I am a knight in
earnest.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You a knight! insolent, saucy fool.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> The devil take me, Mrs. Martha, if I am not
a knight now! a knight-baronet too! A man ought, I
see, to carry his patent in his pocket when he goes to be
married; 'tis more necessary than a licence. I am a
knight indeed and indeed now, Mrs. Martha.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Indeed and indeed, the trick will not pass,
Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Poor wretch! she's afraid she shall not be a
lady.&mdash;Come, come, discover the intrigue, Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> You need not discover the intrigue, 'tis
apparent already. Unworthy Mr. Dapperwit, after my
confidence reposed in you, could you be so little generous
as to betray me to my father's man? but I'll be even
with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Do not accuse him, poor man! before you
hear him.&mdash;Tell her the intrigue, man.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! she will not believe us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Will you not excuse yourself? but I must
not let it rest so.&mdash;Know, then, Mrs. Martha&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Come, I forgive thee before thy confession,
Jonas; you never had had the confidence to have designed
this cheat upon me but from Mr. Dapperwit's
encouragement&mdash;'twas his plot.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Nay, do not do me that wrong, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> But since he has trepanned me out of my
father's house, he is like to keep me as long as I live;
and so good night, Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Hold, hold, what d'ye mean both? prithee
tell her I am Sir Simon, and no Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> A pox! she will not believe us, I tell you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I have provided a supper and parson at
Mulberry-garden, and invited all my friends I could meet
in the Park.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Nay, rather than they shall be disappointed,
there shall be a bride and bridegroom to entertain 'em;
Mrs. Martha and I will go thither presently.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Why, shall she be your bride?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> You see she will have it so.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Will you make Dapperwit your husband?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Rather than my father's man.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Oh, the devil!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Nay, come along, Jonas, you shall make
one at the wedding, since you helped to contrive it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Will you cheat yourself, for fear of being
cheated?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> I am desperate now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Wilt thou let her do so ill a thing, Dapperwit,
as to marry thee? open her eyes, prithee, and tell her I
am a true knight.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> 'Twould be in vain, by my life! you have carried
yourself so like a natural clerk&mdash;and so adieu, good
Jonas. [<i>Exeunt</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> What! ruined by my own plot, like an old
cavalier! yet like him, too, I will plot on still, a plot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
prevention. So! I have it&mdash;her father was here even
now, I'm sure; well&mdash;I'll go tell her father of her, that I
will!</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Another part of the same.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I wish I had not come hither to-night, Leonore.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> Why did you, madam, if the place be so disagreeable
to you?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> We cannot help visiting the place often where we
have lost anything we value: I lost Ranger here last night.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> You thought you had lost him before, a great
while ago; and therefore you ought to be the less
troubled.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But 'twas here I missed him first, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> Come, madam, let not the loss vex you; he is
not worth the looking after.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> It cannot but vex me yet, if I lost him by my
own fault.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> You had but too much care to keep him.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> It often happens, indeed, that too much care is
as bad as negligence; but I had rather be robbed than
lose what I have carelessly.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> But, I believe you would hang the thief if you
could.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Not if I could have my own again.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> I see you would be too merciful.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I wish I were tried.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> But, madam, if you please, we will waive the discourse;
for people seldom (I suppose) talk with pleasure
of their real losses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> 'Tis better than to ruminate on them; mine, I'm
sure, will not out of head nor heart.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> Grief is so far from retrieving a loss, that it makes
it greater; but the way to lessen it is by a comparison
with others' losses. Here are ladies in the Park of your
acquaintance, I doubt not, can compare with you; pray,
madam, let us walk and find 'em out.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> 'Tis the resentment, you say, makes the loss
great or little; and then, I'm sure, there is none like
mine: however, go on. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE V.&mdash;<i>Another part of the same.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I am glad I have found you, for now I am prepared
to lead you out of the dark and all your trouble: I
have good news.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> You are as unmerciful as the physician who with
new arts keeps his miserable patient alive and in hopes,
when he knows the disease is incurable.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> And you, like the melancholy patient, mistrust
and hate your physician, because he will not comply
with your despair: but I'll cure your jealousy now.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> You know, all diseases grow worse by relapses.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Trust me once more.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Well, you may try your experiments upon me.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Just as I shut the door upon you, the woman
Ranger expected came up stairs; but finding another
woman in discourse with him, went down again; I
suppose, as jealous of him, as you of Christina.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How does it appear she came to Ranger?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Thus: Dapperwit came up after he had brought
her, just then, in a chair from St. James's by Ranger's
appointment; and it is certain your Christina came
to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How can that be? for she knew not I was in the
kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> My man confesses, when I sent him to inquire of
her woman about her lady's being here in the Park last
night, he told her you were come; and she, it seems,
told her mistress.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] That might be.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] But did not
Christina confess, Ranger was in her lodging last night?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> By intrusion, which she had more particularly informed
me of, if her apprehensions of your danger had
not posted me after you; she not having yet (as I
suppose) heard of Clerimont's recovery. I left her, poor
creature! at home, distracted with a thousand fears for
your life and love.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Her love, I'm sure, has cost me more fears than
my life; yet that little danger is not past (as you think)
till the great one be over.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Open but your eyes, and the fantastic goblin's
vanished, and all your idle fears will turn to shame; for
jealousy is the basest cowardice.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I had rather, indeed, blush for myself than her.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I'm sure you will have more reason. But is not
that Ranger there?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>;
<i>after them</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I think it is.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I suppose his friend Dapperwit is not far off; I
will examine them both before you, and not leave you so
much as the shadow of doubt: Ranger's astonishment at
my lodging confessed his mistake.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> His astonishment might proceed from Christina's
unexpected strangeness to him.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> He shall satisfy you now himself to the contrary,
I warrant you; have but patience.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I had rather, indeed, he should satisfy my doubts
than my revenge; therefore I can have patience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> But what women are those that follow him?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Stay a little&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Lydia, Lydia&mdash;poor Lydia!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> If she be my rival, 'tis some comfort yet to see
her follow him, rather than he her. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> But if you follow them a little longer, for your
comfort you shall see them go hand in hand.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Sir! sir!&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> She calls to him already.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But he does not hear, you see; let us go a little
nearer.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Sure it is Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> As sure as the woman that follows him closest is
Christina.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> For shame! talk not of Christina; I left her just
now at home, surrounded with so many fears and griefs
she could not stir.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> She is come, it may be, to divert them here in
the Park; I'm sure 'tis she.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> When the moon, at this instant, scarce affords
light enough to distinguish a man from a tree, how can
you know her?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How can you know Ranger, then?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I heard him speak.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> So you may her too, I'll secure you, if you will
draw but a little nearer; she came, doubtless, to no
other end but to speak with him: observe&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.] Sir, I have followed you hitherto;
but now, I must desire you to follow me out of the company;
for I would not be overheard nor disturbed.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Ha! is not this Christina's voice? it is, I am
sure; I cannot be deceived now.&mdash;Dear madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> It is she indeed. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Is it so?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Come, sir&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Nay, I'll follow you too, though not invited.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I must not, cannot stay behind. [<i>Aside.</i>
[<i>They all go off together hastily.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Christina, Isabel</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>on the
other side.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Come along, sir.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> So! I must stick to her when all is done; her
new servant has lost her in the crowd, she has gone too
fast for him; so much my revenge is swifter than his
love. Now shall I not only have the deserted lover's
revenge, of disappointing her of her new man, but an
opportunity infallibly at once to discover her falseness,
and confront her impudence. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Pray come along, sir, I am in haste.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> So eager, indeed!&mdash;I wish that cloud may yet
withhold the moon, that this false woman may not discover
me before I do her. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Here no one can hear us, and I'm sure we cannot
see one another.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> 'Sdeath! what have I giddily run myself upon?
'Tis rather a trial of myself than her;&mdash;I cannot undergo
it. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Come nearer, sir.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Hell and vengeance! I cannot suffer it&mdash;I
cannot. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Come, come; yet nearer,&mdash;pray come
nearer.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> It is impossible! I cannot hold! I must discover
myself, rather than her infamy. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> You are conscious, it seems, of the wrong you
have done me, and are ashamed, though in the dark.
[<i>Speaks, walking slowly.</i></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How's this! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I'm glad to find it so; for all my business with
you is, to show you your late mistakes, and force a confession
from you of those unmannerly injuries you have
done me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> What! I think she's honest; or does she know
me?&mdash;sure she cannot. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> First, your intrusion, last night, into my lodging;
which, I suppose, has begot your other gross mistakes.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> No, she takes me for Ranger, I see again. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> You are to know, then, (since needs you must,)
it was not me you followed last night to my lodging from
the Park, but some kinswoman of yours, it seems, whose
fear of being discovered by you prevailed with me to
personate her, while she withdrew, our habits and our
statures being much alike; which I did with as much
difficulty, as she used importunity to make me; and all
this my Lady Flippant can witness, who was then with
your cousin.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I am glad to hear this. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Now, what your claim to me, at Mr. Vincent's
lodging, meant; the letter and promises you unworthily,
or erroneously, laid to my charge, you must explain to
me and others, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How's this! I hope I shall discover no guilt but my
own:&mdash;she would not speak in threats to a lover. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Was it because you found me in Mr. Vincent's
lodgings you took a liberty to use me like one of your
common visitants? but know, I came no more to Mr.
Vincent than you. Yet, I confess, my visit was intended
to a man&mdash;a brave man, till you made him use a woman
ill; worthy the love of a princess, till you made him
censure mine; good as angels, till you made him
unjust:&mdash;why, in the name of honour, would you do't?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> How happily am I disappointed!&mdash;poor injured
Christina! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> He would have sought me out first, if you had
not made him fly from me. Our mutual love, confirmed
by a contract, made our hearts inseparable, till you
rudely, if not maliciously, thrust in upon us, and broke
the close and happy knot: I had lost him before for a
month, now for ever. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> My joy and pity makes me as mute as my shame;
yet I must discover myself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Your silence is a confession of your guilt.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> I own it. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> But that will not serve my turn; for straight
you must go clear yourself and me to him you have
injured in me! if he has not made too much haste from
me to be found again. You must, I say; for he is a
man that will have satisfaction; and in satisfying him,
you do me.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Then he is satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> How! is it you? then I am not satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Will you be worse than your word?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I gave it not to you.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Come, dear Christina, the jealous, like the
drunkard, has his punishment with his offence.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Valentine! Mr. Valentine!</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Vincent!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Where have you been all this while?
[<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>holds</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>by the hand; who
seems to struggle to get from him.</i></p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Here with my injured Christina.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> She's behind with Ranger, who is forced to speak
all the tender things himself; for she affords him not a
word.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Pish! pish! Vincent; who is blind now? who
deceived now?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You are; for I'm sure Christina is with him.
Come back and see.
[<i>They go out on one side, and return on the other.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Still mocked! still abused! did
you not bid me follow you where we might not be disturbed
or overheard?&mdash;and now not allow me a word!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Did you hear him? [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Yes, yes, peace. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Disowning your letter and me at Mr. Vincent's
lodging, declaring you came to meet another there, and
not me, with a great deal of such affronting unkindness,
might be reasonable enough, because you would not
entrust Vincent with our love; but now, when nobody
sees us nor hears us, why this unseasonable shyness?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> It seems she did not expect him there, but had
appointed to meet another:&mdash;I wish it were so. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> I have not patience!&mdash;do you design thus to
revenge my intrusion into your lodging last night? sure
if you had then been displeased with my company, you
would not have invited yourself to't again by a letter? or
is this a punishment for bringing you to a house so near
your own, where, it seems, you were known too? I do
confess it was a fault; but make me suffer any penance
but your silence, because it is the certain mark of a
mistress's lasting displeasure.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> My&mdash;is not yet come. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Not yet a word! you did not use me so unkindly
last night, when you chid me out of your house, and with
indignation bid me begone. Now, you bid me follow
you, and yet will have nothing to say to me; and I am
more deceived this day and night than I was last night;&mdash;when,
I must confess, I followed you for another&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> I'm glad to hear that. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> One that would have used me better; whose
love I have ungratefully abused for yours; yet from no
other reason but my natural inconstancy.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Poor
Lydia! Lydia!</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> He muttered my name sure; and with a sigh.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But as last night by following (as I thought) her,
I found you, so this night, by following you in vain, I do
resolve, if I can find her again, to keep her for ever.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Now I am obliged, and brought into debt, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
inconstancy:&mdash;faith, now cannot I hold out any longer;
I must discover myself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But, madam, because I intend to see you no
more, I'll take my leave of you for good and all; since
you will not speak, I'll try if you will squeak.
[<i>Goes to throw her down, she squeaks.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Mr. Ranger! Mr. Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Fy! Fy! you need not ravish Christina sure,
that loves you so.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Is it she! Lydia all this while!&mdash;how am I
gulled! and Vincent in the plot too! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Now, false Ranger!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Now, false Christina too!&mdash;you thought I did
not know you now, because I offered you such an unusual
civility.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> You knew me!&mdash;I warrant you knew, too, that
I was the Christina you followed out of the Park last
night! that I was the Christina that writ the letter
too!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Certainly, therefore I would have taken my
revenge, you see, for your tricks.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Is not this the same woman that took refuge in
your house last night, madam? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span>.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> The very same.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> What, Mr. Ranger, we have chopped, and
changed, and hid our Christinas so long and often, that
at last we have drawn each of us our own?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Mr. Valentine in England!&mdash;the truth on't is,
you have juggled together, and drawn without my knowledge;
but since she will have it so, she shall wear me
for good and all now. [<i>Goes to take her by the hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Come not near me.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, you need not be afraid I would ravish you,
now I know you.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> And yet, Leonore, I think 'tis but justice to
pardon the fault I made him commit?
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>, <span class="smcap">Ranger</span> <i>listens.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You consider it right, cousin; for indeed you
are but merciful to yourself in it.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Yet, if I would be rigorous, though I made a blot,
your oversight has lost the game.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> But 'twas rash woman's play, cousin, and ought
not to be played again, let me tell you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Who's there? who's there?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Dapperwit.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Mr. Ranger, I am glad I have met with you, for
I have left my bride just now in the house at Mulberry-garden,
to come and pick up some of my friends in the
Park here to sup with us.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Your bride! are you married then? where is
your bride?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Here at Mulberry-garden, I say, where you, these
ladies and gentlemen, shall all be welcome, if you will
afford me the honour of your company.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> With all our hearts:&mdash;but who have you married?
Lucy?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What! do you think I would marry a wench? I
have married an heiress worth thirty thousand pounds,
let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> An heiress worth thirty thousand pounds!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Mr. Vincent, your servant; you here too?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Nay, we are more of your acquaintance here, I
think.&mdash;Go, we'll follow you, for if you have not dismissed
your parson, perhaps we may make him more work.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE VI.&mdash;<i>The Dining-room in Mulberry-garden House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Simon Addleplot, Gripe</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Flippant</span>,
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martha</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crossbite</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> 'Tis as I told you, sir, you see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Oh, graceless babe! married to a wit! an idle,
loitering, slandering, foul-mouthed, beggarly wit! Oh
that my child should ever live to marry a wit!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Indeed, your worship had better seen her
fairly buried, as they say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> If my daughter there should have done so,
I would not have given her a groat.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Marry a wit!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Mrs. Joyner, do not let me lose the widow
too:&mdash;for if you do, (betwixt friends,) I and my small
annuity are both blown up: it will follow my estate.
[<i>Aside to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> I warrant you. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Let us make sure of Sir Simon to-night, or&mdash;[<i>Aside
to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Joyner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> You need not fear it.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Like the
lawyers, while my clients endeavour to cheat one another,
I in justice cheat 'em both.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Marry a wit!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dapperwit, Ranger, Lydia, Valentine, Christina</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent. Dapperwit</span> <i>stops them, and
they stand all behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What, is he here! Lucy and her mother! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Tell me how thou camest to marry a wit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Pray be not angry, sir, and I'll give you a
good reason.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Reason for marrying a wit!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mar.</i> Indeed, I found myself six months gone
with child, and saw no hopes of your getting me a
husband, or else I had not married a wit, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Joyn.</i> Then you were the wit.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Had you that reason? nay, then&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Holding
up his hands.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> How's that! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Who would have thought, Dapperwit, you would
have married a wench?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ranger</span>.]&mdash;Well, thirty thousand pounds
will make me amends; I have known my betters wink,
and fall on for five or six.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span> <i>and the rest.</i>]
What! you are come, sir, to give me joy? you Mrs. Lucy,
you and you? well, unbid guests are doubly welcome.&mdash;Sir
Simon, I made bold to invite these ladies and gentlemen.&mdash;For
you must know, Mr. Ranger, this worthy Sir
Simon does not only give me my wedding supper, but
my mistress too; and is, as it were, my father.</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> Then I am, as it were, a grandfather to your
new wife's <i>Hans en kelder</i>;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to which you are but, as it
were, a father! there's for you again, sir&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Fools sometimes say unhappy things, if we would
mind 'em; but&mdash;what! melancholy at your daughter's
wedding, sir?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> How deplorable is my condition!</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Nay, if you will rob me of my wench, sir, can
you blame me for robbing you of your daughter? I
cannot be without a woman.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> My daughter, my reputation, and my money
gone!&mdash;but the last is dearest to me. Yet at once I
may retrieve that, and be revenged for the loss of the
other: and all this by marrying Lucy here: I shall get
my five hundred pounds again, and get heirs to exclude
my daughter and frustrate Dapperwit; besides, 'tis agreed
on all hands, 'tis cheaper keeping a wife than a wench.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> If you are so melancholy, sir, we will have the
fiddles and a dance to divert you; come!</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Dance.</i></p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Indeed, you have put me so upon a merry pin,
that I resolve to marry too.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Nay, if my brother come to marrying once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
I may too; I swore I would, when he did, little
thinking&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> I take you at your word, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Flip.</i> Well, but if I had thought you would have
been so quick with me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Where is your parson?</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> What! you would not revenge yourself upon the
parson?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> No, I would have the parson revenge me upon
you; he should marry me.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am glad you are so frolic, sir; but who would
you marry?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> That innocent lady. [<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> That innocent lady!</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> Nay, I am impatient, Mrs. Joyner; pray fetch
him up if he be yet in the house.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> We were not married here:&mdash;but you cannot be
in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> You'll find it so; since you have robbed me of
my housekeeper, I must get another.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> Why, she was my wench!</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I'll make her honest then.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cros.</i> Upon my repute he never saw her before:&mdash;but
will your worship marry my daughter then?</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I promise her and you, before all this good
company, to-morrow I will make her my wife.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Our ladies, sir, I suppose, expect the same
promise from us. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> They may be sure of us without a promise; but
let us (if we can) obtain theirs, to be sure of them.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> But will you marry her to-morrow?&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gripe</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gripe.</i> I will, verily.</p>

<p><i>Dap.</i> I am undone then! ruined, let me perish!</p>

<p><i>Sir Sim.</i> No, you may hire a little room in Covent
Garden, and set up a coffee-house:&mdash;you and your wife
will be sure of the wits' custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dap.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Abused by him I have abused!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fortune our foe we cannot overwit;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By none but thee our projects are cross-bit.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> Come, dear madam, what, yet angry?&mdash;jealousy
sure is much more pardonable before marriage than after
it; but to-morrow, by the help of the parson, you'll put
me out of all my fears.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> I am afraid then you would give me my revenge,
and make me jealous of you; and I had rather suspect
your faith than you should mine.</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> Cousin Lydia, I had rather suspect your faith
too, than you should mine; therefore let us e'en marry
to-morrow, that I may have my turn of watching, dogging,
standing under the window, at the door, behind the
hanging, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> But if I could be desperate now and give you up
my liberty, could you find in your heart to quit all other
engagements, and voluntarily turn yourself over to one
woman, and she a wife too? could you away with the
insupportable bondage of matrimony?</p>

<p><i>Ran.</i> You talk of matrimony as irreverently as my
Lady Flippant: the bondage of matrimony! no&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The end of marriage now is liberty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And two are bound&mdash;to set each other free.</span><br />

<p>If we may trust the author's statement to
Pope, this admirable comedy was written
when Wycherley was twenty-one years of
age, in the year 1661-2. It is impossible
to fix with certainty the date of its first
performance. The Duke's Company,
then under the management of the widow of Sir William
Davenant, opened its new theatre in Dorset Gardens, near
Salisbury Court, on the 9th of November, 1671, with a performance
of Dryden's <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i>, and Wycherley's
"Prologue to the City" points to the production of his play
in the new theatre shortly after its opening. Genest states,
on the authority of Downes, that "<i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>
was the third new play acted at this theatre, and
that several of the old stock plays were acted between each
of the new ones." <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i>, having been three
times performed, was succeeded by Etherege's <i>Love in a
Tub</i>, which, after two representations, gave place to a new
piece, Crowne's tragedy of <i>Charles the Eighth</i>. This was
played six times in succession, and was followed, probably
after an interval devoted to stock pieces, by a second
novelty, an adaptation by Ravenscroft from Molière, entitled
<i>The Citizen turn'd Gentleman, or Mamamouchi</i>, which ran
for nine days together. <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>
was then acted, probably after another short interval, and
must therefore have been produced either in December, 1671,
or in January, 1672. Genest, in fact, places it first on his
list of plays performed at the Dorset Gardens Theatre
during the year 1672, although, in his list for the preceding
year, immediately after <i>The Citizen turn'd Gentleman</i>, he
mentions Lord Orrery's comedy of <i>Mr. Anthony</i> as "nearly
certain" to have been brought out in the season of 1671-2.
But this, again, was a new piece, making the third produced
at Dorset Gardens, without including <i>The Gentleman
Dancing-Master</i>, and must consequently have been brought
forward later than Wycherley's play. Of <i>The Gentleman
Dancing-Master</i> Genest observes that "it was not much
liked, and was acted only six times."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is by no means clear that the first performance at
Dorset Gardens was the actual first performance of our
comedy. The opening verses of the prologue, indeed, seem
to imply a previous and unsuccessful performance, probably
by the same company, at their old theatre in Portugal
Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. This, at least, as it seems to
me, is the most obvious interpretation of the following
lines:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Our author (like us) finding 'twould scarce do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At t'other end o' th' town, is come to you;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, <i>since 'tis his last trial,</i> has that wit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To throw himself on a substantial pit."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The presumption, therefore, is strongly in favour of 1671 as
the year in which <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i> was first
brought upon the stage. It was published, without a
dedication or the names of the actors, in 1673. The remarks
about "packing to sea" in the epilogue, which, like the
prologue, was written for the production, or rather, as we
may suppose, the revival of the piece at the theatre in
Dorset Gardens, refer, questionless, to the impending war
with the Dutch, against whom the formal declaration of war
was issued on the 17th of March, 1672.</p>

<p>The incident upon which the plot turns is borrowed from
Calderon's comedy, <i>El Maestro de Danzar</i>, but a brief
review of the corresponding scenes in that drama will prove
how trifling was Wycherley's obligation to the great Spanish
poet. Leonor, the heroine of the piece, is enjoying a stolen
interview with her lover, Don Enrique, in an apartment of
her father's house in Valencia. Meanwhile, lest their voices
should be overheard, Ines, Leonor's maid, stations herself
without the chamber, singing and accompanying herself with
the guitar. She presently enters, declaring that an instrument
so out of tune will attract suspicion, and Don Enrique
takes up the guitar for the purpose of tuning it. At this
juncture the father, Don Diego, appears suddenly upon the
scene. In reply to his questioning, Leonor explains that,
dancing being little in fashion at the Court, she had formerly
neglected that accomplishment; but that, finding herself, on
that account, looked down upon in Valencia, where dancing
was all the mode, she had engaged a master, who had but just
taken up the guitar which her maid had brought him, when
her father entered. This explanation proving satisfactory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Don Diego, he seats himself, and desires that the lesson
may proceed. But here a new difficulty arises, for Don
Enrique owns, in an "aside" to his mistress, that he understands
little or nothing of dancing. The lady, however, is
equal to the occasion, and, affecting diffidence, tells her
father that he must wait until she has taken a few lessons.
He, nevertheless, insisting, Don Enrique takes again the
guitar, and, under pretence of tuning it, screws up the string
until it snaps, declaring then that the strings are worn, and
that the instrument is broken. Leonor now suggests that
the maestro shall carry away the guitar, to get it set in order,
and shall come again on the morrow or in the evening; and
Don Diego, acquiescing, bids him neglect not to return,
trusting him for the payment. Don Enrique responding
that he will not fail, although he has many lessons to give,
the old cavalier dismisses him with a "Vaya con Dios." In
a later scene Don Enrique is again with Leonor, of whom
he has conceived unjust suspicions, and is bestowing upon
her the full benefit of his jealousy, when Ines announces the
approach of Don Diego, and the lover, at his mistress's
earnest appeal, again takes up the guitar, and pretends to be
giving her a lesson. The father inquires after his daughter's
improvement, and again insists on seeing her dance, a mock
performance this time actually ensuing. And again, in another
scene, the lovers, similarly interrupted, have recourse to a
similar method of diverting Don Diego's suspicions.</p>

<p>In these few incidents, and in the name of Don Diego,
which our author has employed as the adopted appellation
of his Spain-loving Englishman, are to be found the only
points of resemblance between the two plays. The merits
of the one lie in a direction totally diverse from that in
which the excellencies of the other are to be sought.
Wycherley's play is fairly overflowing with wit and mirth,
qualities in which the Spanish drama is somewhat deficient.
On the other hand, the English play affords no counterpart
to the high moral tone and exalted passion which are distinguishing
characteristics of Calderon's comedy.</p>

<p><i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i> is constructed with
greater simplicity and unity of action than <i>Love in a Wood</i>,
and, although less powerfully written than <i>The Country
Wife</i>, it is also far less exceptionable, and more uniformly
pleasing.</p>

we are!</p>

a cousin!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nor to drink a pint of wine with a friend at the
Prince in the Sun!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nor to hear a fiddle in good company!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nor to hear the organs and tongs at the Gun in
Moorfields!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, not suffered to go to church, because the
men are sometimes there!&mdash;Little did I think I should
ever have longed to go to church.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Or I either;&mdash;but between two maids&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nor see a man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nor come near a man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nor hear of a man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> No, miss; but to be denied a man! and to
have no use at all of a man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Hold, hold!&mdash;your resentment is as much
greater than mine, as your experience has been greater.
But all this while, what do we make of my cousin, my
husband elect, as my aunt says? We have had his
company these three days; is he no man?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> No, faith, he's but a monsieur. But you'll
resolve yourself that question within these three days; for
by that time he'll be your husband, if your father come
to-night&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Or if I provide not myself with another in the
mean time: for fathers seldom choose well; and I will
no more take my father's choice in a husband, than I a
would in a gown, or a suit of knots. So that if that
cousin of mine were not an ill-contrived, ugly, freakish
fool, in being my father's choice I should hate him.
Besides, he has almost made me out of love with mirth
and good-humour; for he debases it as much as a jack-pudding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and civility and good breeding more than a
city dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> What! won't you marry him then, madam?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Would'st thou have me marry a fool, an idiot?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Lord! 'tis a sign you have been kept up indeed,
and know little of the world, to refuse a man for a
husband only because he's a fool! Methinks he's a
pretty apish kind of a gentleman, like other gentlemen,
and handsome enough to lie with in the dark, when
husbands take their privileges; and for the day-times,
you may take the privilege of a wife.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Excellent governess! you do understand the
world, I see.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Then you should be guided by me.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Art thou in earnest then, damned jade?&mdash;would'st
thou have me marry him?&mdash;Well, there are more poor
young women undone, and married to filthy fellows by
the treachery and evil counsel of chambermaids, than by
the obstinacy and covetousness of parents.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Does not your father come on purpose out of
Spain to marry you to him? Can you release yourself
from your aunt or father any other way? Have you a
mind to be shut up as long as you live? For my part,
though you can hold out upon the lime from the walls
here, salt, old shoes, and oatmeal, I cannot live so: I
must confess my patience is worn out.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Alas, alas, poor Prue! your stomach lies another
way: I will take pity of you, and get me a husband very
suddenly, who may have a servant at your service. But
rather than marry my cousin, I will be a nun in the new
protestant nunnery they talk of; where, they say, there
will be no hopes of coming near a man.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> But you can marry nobody but your cousin,
miss: your father you expect to-night; and be certain
his Spanish policy and wariness, which has kept you up
so close ever since you came from Hackney school, will
make sure of you within a day or two at farthest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Then 'tis time to think how to prevent him&mdash;stay&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> In vain, vain, miss!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> If we knew but any man, any man, though he
were but a little handsomer than the devil, so that he
were a gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> What if you did know any man? if you had an
opportunity, could you have confidence to speak to a
man first? but if you could, how could you come to him,
or he to you? nay, how could you send to him? for
though you could write, which your father in his Spanish
prudence would never permit you to learn, who should
carry the letter?&mdash;But we need not be concerned for that,
since we know not to whom to send it.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Stay&mdash;it must be so&mdash;I'll try however&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Monsieur de <span class="smcap">Paris</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Serviteur! serviteur! la cousine;</i> I come to
give the <i>bon soir</i>, as the French say.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> O, cousin! you know him; the fine gentleman
they talk of so much in town.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> What! will you talk to him of any man else?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I know all the <i>beau monde, cousine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Master&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Monsieur Taileur, Monsieur Esmit, Monsieur&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> These are Frenchmen&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non</i>; voud you have me say Mr. Taylor,
Mr. Smith? Fi! fi! <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But don't you know the brave gentleman they
talk so much of in town?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Who? Monsieur Gerrard?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What kind of man is that Mr. Gerrard? and
then I'll tell you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why&mdash;he is truly a pretty man, a pretty man&mdash;a
pretty so so&mdash;kind of man, for an Englishman.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> How a pretty man?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why, he is conveniently tall&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But what?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And not ill-shaped&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But what?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And handsome, as 'tis thought, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But! what are your exceptions to him?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I can't tell you, because they are innumerable,
innumerable, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Has he wit?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, they say, he's witty, brave, and <i>de bel
humeur</i>, and well-bred, with all that&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But what? does he want judgment?</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non</i>: they say he has good sense and judgment;
but it is according to the account Englis&mdash;for&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> For what?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> For, <i>jarni!</i> if I think it.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why?&mdash;why his tailor lives within Ludgate&mdash;his
<i>valet de chambre</i> is no Frenchman&mdash;and he has been
seen at noon-day to go into an English eating-house&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Say you so, cousin!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Then for being well-bred, you shall judge:&mdash;First,
he can't dance a step, nor sing a French song, nor
swear a French oate, nor use the polite French word in
his conversation; and in fine, can't play at hombre&mdash;but
speaks base good Englis, with the commune home-bred
pronunciation; and in fine, to say no more, he
never carries a snuff-box about with him.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And yet this man has been abroad as much as
any man, and does not make the least show of it, but a
little in his mien, not at all in his discour, <i>jarni!</i> He
never talks so much as of St. Peter's church at Rome,
the Escurial, or Madrid; nay, not so much as of Henry
IV., of Pont-neuf, Paris, and the new Louvre, nor of the
Grand Roi.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis for his commendation, if he does not talk of
his travels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh! auh!&mdash;<i>cousine</i>&mdash;he is conscious to himself
of his wants, because he is very envious; for he cannot
endure me.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He shall be my man then for that.&mdash;Ay,
ay! 'tis the same, Prue.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] No, I know he can't
endure you, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How do you know it&mdash;who never stir out? <i>tête
non!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well&mdash;dear cousin,&mdash;if you will promise me
never to tell my aunt, I'll tell you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I won't, I won't, <i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nor to be concerned yourself, so as to make a
quarrel of it.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Upon the word of a gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Mons. Foi de chevalier</i>, I will not quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Lord, miss! I wonder you won't believe him
without more ado.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Then he has the hatred of a rival for you.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Malepeste!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You know my chamber is backward, and has a
door into the gallery which looks into the back yard of a
tavern, whence Mr. Gerrard once spying me at the
window, has often since attempted to come in at that
window by the help of the leads of a low building adjoining;
and, indeed, 'twas as much as my maid and I could
do to keep him out.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Ah, le coquin!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But nothing is stronger than aversion; for I hate
him perfectly, even as much as I love you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> I believe so, faith!&mdash;but what design have we
now on foot? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> This discovery is an argument, sure, of my love
to you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, say no more, cousin, I doubt not your
amour for me, because I doubt not your judgment.
But what's to be done with this fanfaron?&mdash;I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
where he eats to-night&mdash;I'll go find him out, <i>ventre
bleu!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> O, my dear cousin, you will not make a quarrel
of it? I thought what your promise would come to!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Would you have a man of honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Keep his promise?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And lose his mistress?&mdash;That were not for my
honour, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Cousin, though you do me the injury to think I
could be false, do not do yourself the injury to think any
one could be false to you. Will you be afraid of losing
your mistress? To show such a fear to your rival, were
for his honour, and not for yours, sure.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, cousin, I'd have you know I was never
afraid of losing my mistress in earnest.&mdash;Let me see the
man can get my mistress from me, <i>jarni!</i>&mdash;But he that
loves must seem a little jealous.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Not to his rival: those that have jealousy hide it
from their rivals.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But there are some who say, jealousy is no
more to be hid than a cough:&mdash;but it should never be
discovered in me, if I had it, because it is not French at
all&mdash;<i>ventre bleu!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, you should rally your rival, and rather make
a jest of your quarrel to him; and that, I suppose, is
French too.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> 'Tis so, 'tis so, <i>cousine</i>; 'tis the veritable French
method; for your Englis, for want of wit, drive every
thing to a serious grum quarrel, and then would make
a jest on't, when 'tis too late, when they can't laugh,
<i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, yes, I would have you rally him soundly:
do not spare him a jot.&mdash;But shall you see him to-night?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes; pray be sure to see him for the jest's sake.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I will&mdash;for I love a jest as well as any <i>bel esprit</i>
of 'em all&mdash;da!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay, and rally him soundly; be sure you rally him
soundly, and tell him just thus:&mdash;that the lady he has so
long courted, from the great window of the Ship tavern,
is to be your wife to-morrow, unless he come at his
wonted hour of six in the morning to her window to
forbid the banns; for 'tis the first and last time of asking;
and if he come not, let him for ever hereafter stay away,
and hold his tongue.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! a ver good jest, <i>tête bleu!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And if the fool should come again, I would tell
him his own, I warrant you, cousin. My gentleman
should be satisfied for good and all, I'd secure him.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Bon, bon.</i></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Well, well, young mistress; you were not at
Hackney school for nothing, I see; nor taken away for
nothing.&mdash;A woman may soon be too old, but is never
too young to shift for herself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! <i>cousine</i>, dou art a merry grig, <i>ma
foi!</i>&mdash;I long to be with Gerrard; and I am the best at
improving a jest&mdash;I shall have such divertisement to-night,
<i>tête bleu!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> He'll deny, may be, at first, that he ever courted
any such lady.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, I am sure he'll be ashamed of it, I shall
make him look so sillily, <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;I long to find him
out.&mdash;Adieu, adieu, <i>la cousine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Shall you be sure to find him?</p>

<p><i>Mons. Indubitablement</i>, I'll search the town over, but
I'll find him: ha! ha! ha!&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>, <i>and
returns.</i>]&mdash;But I'm afraid, <i>cousine</i>, if I should tell him
you are to be my wife to-morrow, he would not come:
now, I am for having him come for the jest's sake,
<i>ventre!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So am I, cousin, for having him come too for the
jest's sake.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, well, leave it to me:&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> What's all this giggling here?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Hey! do you tinke we'll tell you? no, fait, I
warrant you, <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My cousin is overjoyed, I suppose, that my father
is to come to-night.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I am afraid he will not come to-night:&mdash;but
you'll stay and see, nephew?</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non</i>: I am to sup at t'other end of the
town to-night&mdash;La, la, la&mdash;Ra, ra, ra&mdash;[<i>Exit, singing.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I wish the French levity of this young man
may agree with your father's Spanish gravity.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Just as your crabbed old age and my youth
agree.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well, malapert, I know you hate me,
because I have been the guardian of your reputation:
but your husband may thank me one day.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> If he be not a fool, he would rather be obliged to
me for my virtue than to you, since, at long run, he must,
whether he will or no.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> So, so!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, now I think on't, I'd have you to know, the
poor man, whosoe'er he is, will have little cause to thank
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No; for I never lived so wicked a life as I have
done this twelvemonth, since I have not seen a man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> How, how! if you have not seen a man,
how could you be wicked? how could you do any ill?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, I have done no ill; but I have paid it with
thinking.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> O that's no hurt! to think, is no hurt:&mdash;ancient,
grave, and godly, cannot help thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I warrant, you have had 'em yourself, aunt?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Yes, yes, when I cannot sleep.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ha! ha!&mdash;I believe it. But know, I have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
those thoughts sleeping and waking; for I have dreamt
of a man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No matter, no matter, so that it was but
a dream: I have dreamt myself. For you must know,
widows are mightily given to dream; insomuch that a
dream is waggishly called "the Widow's Comfort."</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I did not only dream&mdash;[<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> How, how! did you more than dream?
speak, young harlotry! confess; did you more than
dream? How could you do more than dream in this
house? speak, confess!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, I will then. Indeed, aunt, I did not
only dream, but I was pleased with my dream when I
awaked.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Oh, is that all?&mdash;Nay, if a dream only will
please you, you are a modest young woman still: but
have a care of a vision.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay; but to be delighted when we wake with a
naughty dream, is a sin, aunt; and I am so very
scrupulous, that I would as soon consent to a naughty
man as to a naughty dream.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I do believe you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I am for going into the throng of temptations.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> There I believe you again.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And making myself so familiar with them, that I
would not be concerned for 'em a whit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> There I do not believe you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And would take all the innocent liberty of the
town:&mdash;to tattle to your men under a vizard in the playhouses,
and meet 'em at night in masquerade.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> There I do believe you again; I know you
would be masquerading: but worse would come on't, as
it has done to others who have been in a masquerade,
and are now virgins but in masquerade, and will not be
their own women again as long as they live. The
children of this age must be wise children indeed if they
know their fathers, since their mothers themselves cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
inform 'em! O, the fatal liberty of this masquerading
age! when I was a young woman&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come, come, do not blaspheme this masquerading
age, like an ill-bred city-dame, whose husband is half
broke by living in Covent-garden, or who has been
turned out of the Temple or Lincoln's-Inn upon a
masquerading night. By what I've heard, 'tis a pleasant,
well-bred, complaisant, free, frolic, good-natured, pretty
age: and if you do not like it, leave it to us that do.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Lord, how impudently you talk, niece!
I'm sure I remember when I was a maid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Can you remember it, reverend aunt?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Yes, modest niece,&mdash;that a raw young
thing, though almost at woman's estate, (that was then at
thirty or thirty-five years of age,) would not so much as
have looked upon a man&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Above her father's butler or coachman.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Still taking me up! Well, thou art a mad
girl; and so good night. We may go to bed; for I
suppose now your father will not come to-night. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I'm sorry for it; for I long to see him.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
But I lie: I had rather see Gerrard here; and
yet I know not how I shall like him. If he has wit, he
will come; and if he has none, he would not be welcome.

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The French House.&mdash;A table, bottles, and
candles.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Gerrard, Martin</span>, <i>and</i> Monsieur de <span class="smcap">Paris</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> 'Tis ver veritable, <i>jarni!</i> what the French say
of you Englis: you use the debauch so much, it cannot
have with you the French operation; you are never
enjoyee. But come, let us for once be <i>infiniment gaillard</i>,
and sing a French sonnet.
[<i>Sings,&mdash;"La bouteille, la bouteille, glou, glou."</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.] What a melodious fop it is!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh! you have no complaisance.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, we can't sing; but we'll drink to you the
lady's health, whom (you say) I have so long courted at
her window.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, there is your complaisance: all your Englis
complaisance is pledging complaisance, <i>ventre!</i>&mdash;But if
I do you reason here, [<i>Takes the glass.</i>]&mdash;will you do me
reason to a little French <i>chanson à boire</i> I shall begin to
you?&mdash;[<i>Sings.</i>] <i>"La bouteille, la bouteille&mdash;"</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.] I had rather keep company with
a set of wide-mouthed, drunken cathedral choristers.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, sir, drink; and he shall do you reason to
your French song, since you stand upon't.&mdash;Sing him
"Arthur of Bradley," or "I am the Duke of Norfolk."</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh! <i>tête bleu!</i>&mdash;an Englis catch! fy! fy!
<i>ventre!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> He can sing no damned French song.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nor can I drink the damned Englis wine.
[<i>Sets down the glass.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, to that lady's health, who has commanded
me to wait upon her to-morrow at her window, which
looks (you say) into the inward yard of the Ship tavern,
near the end of what-d'ye-call't street.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay; do you not know her? not you! <i>vert
bleu!</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But, pray repeat again what she said.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why, she said she is to be married to-morrow to
a person of honour, a brave gentleman, that shall be
nameless, and so, and so forth.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Little does he
think who 'tis!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And what else?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> That if you make not your appearance before
her window to-morrow at your wonted hour of six in the
morning, to forbid the banns, you must for ever hereafter
stay away and hold your tongue; for 'tis the first and last
time of asking.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> 'Tis all a riddle to me: I should be unwilling to
be fooled by this coxcomb. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I won't tell him all she said, lest he should not
go: I would fain have him go for the jest's sake&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Her name is, you say, Hippolita, daughter to a
rich Spanish merchant.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, you don't know her, not you! <i>à d'autre,
à d'autre, ma foi!</i>&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, I will be an easy fool for once.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> By all means go.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, by all means go&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] To be caught in a fool's trap&mdash;I'll
venture it.&mdash;[<i>Drinks to him.</i>] Come, 'tis her health.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And to your good reception&mdash;<i>tête bleu!</i>&mdash;ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, monsieur, I'll say this for thee, thou hast
made the best use of three months at Paris as ever
English squire did.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Considering I was in a dam Englis pension
too.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yet you have conversed with some French, I
see; footmen, I suppose, at the fencing-school? I judge
it by your oaths.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> French footmen! well, well, I had rather have
the conversation of a French footman than of an Englis
'squire; there's for you, da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I beg your pardon, monsieur; I did not think
the French footmen had been so much your friends.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, yes, I warrant they have obliged him at Paris
much more than any of their masters did. Well, there
shall be no more said against the French footmen.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, de grace!</i>&mdash;you are always turning the
nation <i>Française</i> into ridicule, dat nation so accomplie,
dat nation which you imitate so, dat in the conclusion,
you butte turn yourself into ridicule, <i>ma foi!</i> If you are
for de raillery, abuse the Dutch, why not abuse the Dutch?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<i>les gros villains, pendards</i>, insolents; but here in your
England, <i>ma foi!</i>&mdash;you have more honeur, respecte, and
estimation for de Dushe swabber, who come to cheat
your nation, den for de Franch footman, who come to
oblige your nation.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Our nation! then you disown it for yours, it
seems.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well! wat of dat? are you the disobligee by
dat?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, monsieur, far from it; you could not oblige
us, nor your country, any other way than by disowning
it.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> It is de brutal country, which abuse de France,
and reverence de Dushe; I will maintain, sustain, and
justifie, dat one little Franch footman have more honeur,
courage, and generosity, more good blood in his vaines,
an mush more good manners an civility den all de State-General
together, <i>jarni!</i>&mdash;Dey are only wise and valiant
wen dey are drunkee.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> That is, always.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But dey are never honest wen dey are drunkee;
dey are de only rogue in de varlde who are not honeste
when dey are drunk&mdash;<i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I find you are well acquainted with them,
monsieur.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, I have made the toure of Holland, but
it was <i>en poste</i>, dere was no staying for me, <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;for
de gentleman can no more live dere den de toad in
Ir'land, <i>ma foi!</i> for I did not see on' chevalier in de
whole countree: alway, you know, de rebel hate de gens
de quality. Besides, I had made sufficient observation of
the <i>canaille barbare</i> de first nightee of my arrival at
Amsterdamme: I did visit, you must know, one of de
principal of de State-General, to whom I had recommendation
from England, and did find his excellence
weighing soap, <i>jarni!</i>&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Weighing soap!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Weighing soap, <i>ma foi!</i> for he was a wholesale
chandeleer; and his lady was taking de tale of chandels
wid her own witer hands, <i>ma foi!</i> and de young lady,
his excellence daughter, stringing harring, stringing
harring, <i>jarni!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So!&mdash;and what were his sons doing?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Augh&mdash;his son (for he had but one) was making
the tour of France, Espagne, Italy, and Germany, in a
coach and six; or rader, now I tink on't, gone of an
embassy hider to dere master Cromwell, whom dey did
love and fear, because he was someting de greater rebel.
But now I talk of de <i>rebelle</i>, none but the rebel can love
the <i>rebelle</i>. And so much for you and your friend the
Dushe; I'll say no more, and pray do you say no more
of my friend de Franch, not so mush as of my friend de
Franch footman&mdash;da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, no;&mdash;but, monsieur, now give me leave to
admire thee, that in three months at Paris you could
renounce your language, drinking, and your country, (for
which we are not angry with you,) as I said, and come
home so perfect a Frenchman, that the draymen of your
father's own brewhouse would be ready to knock thee on
the head.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Vel, vel, my father was a merchant of his own
beer, as the <i>noblesse</i> of Franch of their own wine.&mdash;But
I can forgive you that raillery, that bob,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> since
you say I have the eyre <i>Français</i>:&mdash;but have I the
eyre <i>Français</i>?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> As much as any French footman of 'em all.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And do I speak agreeable ill Englis enough?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Very ill.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Véritablement?</i></p>

<p><i>Ger. Véritablement.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> For you must know, 'tis as ill breeding now to
speak good Englis as to write good Englis, good sense,
or a good hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But, indeed, methinks you are not slovenly
enough for a Frenchman.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Slovenly! you mean negligent?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, I mean slovenly.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Then I will be more slovenly.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> You know, to be a perfect Frenchman, you must
never be silent, never sit still, and never be clean.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But you have forgot one main qualification of a
true Frenchman, he should never be sound, that is, be
very pocky too.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Oh! if dat be all, I am very pocky; pocky
enough, <i>jarni!</i> that is the only French qualification may
be had without going to Paris, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> Here are a couple of ladies coming up to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> To us!&mdash;did you appoint any to come hither,
Martin?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Not I.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nor you, monsieur?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nor I.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Sirrah, tell your master, if he cannot protect us
from the constable, and these midnight coursers, 'tis not
a house for us.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Tell 'em you have nobody in the house, and
shut the doors.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> They'll not be satisfied with that, they'll break
open the door. They searched last night all over the
house for my Lord Fisk, and Sir Jeffery Jantee, who
were fain to hide themselves in the bar under my
mistress's chair and petticoats.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Wat, do the women hunt out the men so now?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay, ay, things are altered since you went to
Paris; there's hardly a young man in town dares be
known of his lodging for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Bailiffs, pursuivants, or a city constable, are
modest people in comparison of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And we are not so much afraid to be taken up
by the watch as by the tearing midnight ramblers, or
huzza women.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Jarni!</i> ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Where are they? I hope they are gone again.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> No, sir, they are below at the stair-foot, only
swearing at their coachman.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, you rogue, they are in fee with you
waiters, and no gentleman can come hither, but they
have the intelligence straight.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> Intelligence from us, sir! they should never
come here, if we could help it. I am sure we wish 'em
choked when we see them come in; for they bring such
good stomachs from St James's Park, or rambling about
in the streets, that we poor waiters have not a bit left;
'tis well if we can keep our money in our pockets for 'em.
I am sure I have paid seventeen and sixpence in half-crowns
for coach-hire at several times for a little damned
tearing lady, and when I asked her for it again one
morning in her chamber, she bid me pay myself, for she
had no money; but I wanted the courage of a gentleman;
besides, the lord that kept her was a good
customer to our house and my friend, and I made a
conscience of wronging him.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> A man of honour!</p>

<p><i>Mons. Vert</i> and <i>bleu!</i> pleasant, pleasant, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Go, go, sirrah, shut the door, I hear 'em coming
up.</p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> Indeed I dare not; they'll kick me down stairs,

violence to you; you are not fit for our service: we
know you.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> The hot service you have been in formerly
makes you unfit for ours now; besides, you begin to be
something too old for us; we are for the brisk huzzas of
seventeen or eighteen.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, faith, I am not too old yet; but an old
acquaintance will make any man old:&mdash;besides, to tell
you the truth, you are come a little too early for me, for
I am not drunk yet. But there are your brisk young
men, who are always drunk, and, perhaps, have the
happiness not to know you.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> The happiness not to know us!</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> The happiness not to know us!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Be not angry, ladies; 'tis rather happiness to
have pleasure to come than to have it past, and therefore
these gentlemen are happy in not knowing you.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I'd have you to know, I do know the ladies too,
and I will not lose the honour of the ladies' acquaintance
for anything.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> Not for the pleasure of beginning an acquaintance
with us, as Mr. Gerrard says: but it is the general
vanity of you town fops to lay claim to all good acquaintance
and persons of honour; you cannot let a woman
pass in the Mall at midnight, but, damn you, you know
her straight, you know her;&mdash;but you would be damned
before you would say so much for one in a mercer's
shop.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> He has spoken it in a French-house, where he
has very good credit, and I dare swear you may make
him eat his words.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> She does want a gown, indeed; she is in her
<i>déshabillé</i>. This <i>déshabillé</i> is a great mode in England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the women love the <i>déshabillé</i> as well as the men, <i>ma
foi!</i> [<i>Peeping under her scarf.</i></p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Well, if we should stay and sup with you, I
warrant you would be bragging of it to-morrow amongst
your comrades, that you had the company of two women
of quality at the French-house, and name us.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pleasant jilts! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, upon our honours, we would not brag of
your company.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> Upon your honours?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> No, faith.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> Come, we will venture to sit down then: yet I
know the vanity of you men; you could not contain
yourselves from bragging.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, no; you women now-a-days have found out the
pleasure of bragging, and will allow it the men no longer.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Therefore, indeed, we dare not stay to sup with
you; for you would be sure to tell on't.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And we are young men who stand upon our
reputations.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> You are very pleasant, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> For my part I am to be married shortly, and
know 'twould quickly come to my mistress's ear.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And for my part I must go visit to-morrow
betimes a new city mistress; and you know they are as
inquisitive as precise in the city.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Come, come; pray leave this fooling; sit down
again, and let us bespeak supper.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, faith, I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Besides, we have supped.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> No matter, we only desire you should look on
while we eat, and put the glass about, or so.
[<span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>offer to go.</i></p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Pray, stay.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Upon my life I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> Upon our honours we will not tell, if you are in
earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Pshaw! pshaw!&mdash;I know the vanity of you
women; you could not contain yourselves from bragging.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Ma foi!</i> is it certain? ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Hark
you, madam, can't you fare well but you must cry roast-meat?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Than you would of a clap, if you had it; dat's
the only secret you can keep, <i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Wat! must we leave the lady then? dis is dam
civility Englis, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Nay, sir, you have too much of the French air,
to have so little honour and good breeding.
[<i>Pulling him back.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Dee you tinke so then, sweet madam, I have
mush of de French eyre?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> More than any Frenchman breathing.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh, you are the curtoise dame; <i>morbleu!</i> I
shall stay then, if you think so. Monsieur Gerrard, you
will be certain to see the lady to-morrow? pray not
forget, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, no, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> You will go then?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I will go on a fool's errand for once.

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;Don <span class="smcap">Diego's</span> <i>House in the morning.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span> <i>in a Spanish habit, and</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Have you had a Spanish care of the
honour of my family? that is to say,
have you kept my daughter close in
my absence, as I directed?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I have sir, but it was
as much as I could do.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I knew that; for 'twas as much as I could do to
keep up her mother;&mdash;I that have been in Spain, look
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay 'tis a hard task to keep up an Englishwoman.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> As hard as it is for those who are not kept up to
be honest, look you, <i>con licencia</i>, sister.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> How now, brother! I am sure my husband
never kept me up.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I knew that, therefore I cried <i>con licencia</i>, sister,
as the Spaniards have it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> But you Spaniards are too censorious,
brother.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You Englishwomen, sister, give us too much
cause, look you;&mdash;but you are sure my daughter has not
seen a man since my departure?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, not so much as a churchman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> As a churchman! <i>voto!</i> I thank you for that;
not a churchman! not a churchman!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, not so much as a churchman; but
of any, one would think one might trust a churchman.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, we are bold enough in trusting them with our
souls, I'll never trust them with the body of my daughter,
look you, <i>guarda!</i> You see what comes of trusting
churchmen here in England; and 'tis because the women
govern the families, that chaplains are so much in
fashion. Trust a churchman!&mdash;trust a coward with your
honour, a fool with your secret, a gamester with your
purse, as soon as a priest with your wife or daughter;
look you, <i>guarda!</i> I am no fool, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, I know you are a wise man, brother.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Why, sister, I have been fifteen years in Spain
for it, at several times, look you: now in Spain, he is
wise enough that is grave, politic enough that says little,
and honourable enough that is jealous; and though I say
it, that should not say it, I am as grave, grum, and
jealous, as any Spaniard breathing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I know you are, brother.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> And will be a Spaniard in everything still, and
will not conform, not I, to their ill-favoured English
customs, for I will wear my Spanish habit still, I will
stroke my Spanish whiskers still, and I will eat my
Spanish <i>olio</i> still; and my daughter shall go a maid to
her husband's bed, let the English custom be what 'twill:
I would fain see any finical, cunning, insinuating monsieur
of the age, debauch, or steal away my daughter.
But, well, has she seen my cousin? how long has he
been in England?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> These three days.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> And she has seen him, has she? I was
contented he should see her, intending him for her
husband; but she has seen nobody else upon your
certain knowledge?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, no, alas! how should she? 'tis impossible
she should.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Where is her chamber? pray let me see her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> You'll find her, poor creature, asleep, I
warrant you: or, if awake, thinking no hurt, nor of your
coming this morning.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Let us go to her, I long to see her, poor
innocent wretch. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita, Gerrard</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span> <i>at a distance.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Am I not come upon your own summons,
madam? and yet receive me so?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My summons, sir! no, I assure you; and if you
do not like your reception, I cannot help it; for I am
not used to receive men, I'd have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> She is beautiful beyond all things I ever saw.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I like him extremely! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, fairest, why do you frown?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Because I am angry.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I am come on purpose to please you, then; do
not receive me so unkindly.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I tell you, I do not use to receive men.&mdash;There
has not been a man in the house before, but my cousin,
this twelvemonth, I'd have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Then you ought to bid me the more welcome,
I'd have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What! do you mock me too? I know I am but
a home-bred simple girl! but I thought you gallants of
the town had been better bred than to mock a poor girl
in her father's own house. I have heard, indeed, 'tis a
part of good breeding to mock people behind their
backs, but not to their faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Pretty creature! she has not only the
beauty, but the innocency of an angel.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.]
Mock you, dear miss! no, I only repeated the words because
they were yours, sweet miss; what we like we imitate.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> "Dear miss! sweet miss!" how came you and I
so well acquainted? this is one of your confident tricks,
too, as I have been told; you'll be acquainted with a
woman in the time you can help her over a bench in the
playhouse, or to her coach. But I need not wonder at
your confidence, since you could come in at the great
gallery window, just now. But, pray, who shall pay for
the glass you have broken?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Pretty creature! your father might have made
the window bigger then, since he has so fine a
daughter, and will not allow people to come in at the
door to her.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> A pleasant man!&mdash;well, 'tis harder playing the
hypocrite with him, I see, than with my aunt or father;
and if dissimulation were not very natural to a woman, I'm
sure I could not use it at this time: but the mask of
simplicity and innocency is as useful to an intriguing
woman as the mask of religion to a statesman, they say.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Why do you look away, dearest miss?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Because you quarrelled with me just now for
frowning upon you, and I cannot help it, if I look upon
you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> O! let me see that face at any rate.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Would you have me frown upon you? for I shall
be sure to do't.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, I'll stand fair: you have done your worst
to my heart already.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Now I dare not look upon him, lest I should not
be able to keep my word. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, I am ready:&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] and yet I am afraid
of her frowns.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.] Come, look, Ih&mdash;am
ready, Ih&mdash;am ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I am not ready. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Turn, dear miss, come, Ih&mdash;am ready.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Are you ready then? I'll look. [<i>Turns upon
him.</i>]&mdash;No, faith, I cannot frown upon him, if I should
be hanged. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Dear miss, I thank you, that look has no
terror in't.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, I cannot frown for my heart for blushing, I
don't use to look upon men, you must know.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> If it were possible anything could, those blushes
would add to her beauty: well, bashfulness is the only
out-of-fashioned thing that is agreeable. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ih&mdash;h&mdash;like this man strangely, I was going to
say loved him. Courage then, Hippolita! make use of
the only opportunity thou canst have to enfranchise
thyself. Women formerly (they say) never knew how to
make use of their time till it was past; but let it not be
said so of a young woman of this age.&mdash;My damned aunt
will be stirring presently:&mdash;well, then, courage, I say,
Hippolita!&mdash;thou art full fourteen years old,&mdash;shift for
thyself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So! I have looked upon her so long, till I am
grown bashful too. Love and modesty come together
like money and covetousness, and the more we have, the
less we can show it. I dare not look her in the face now,
nor speak a word. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What, sir, methinks you look away now!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Because you would not look upon me, miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, I hope you can't look me in the face, since
you have done so rude a thing as to come in at the
window upon me. Come, come, when once we women
find the men bashful, then we take heart. Now I can
look upon you as long as you will; let's see if you can
frown upon me now.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Lovely innocency! no, you may swear I can't
frown upon you, miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So! I knew you were ashamed of what you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
done. Well, since you are ashamed, and because you
did not come of your own head, but were sent by my
cousin, you say&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Which I wonder at. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> For all these reasons, I do forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> In token of your forgiveness then, dearest miss,
let me have the honour to kiss your hand.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, there 'tis; you men are like our little
shock dogs:<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> if we don't keep you off from us, but use you
a little kindly, you grow so fiddling and so troublesome,
there is no enduring you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> O dear miss! if I am like your shock-dog, let it
be in his privileges.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, I'd have you know he does not lie with
me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> 'Twas well guessed, miss, for one so innocent.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, I always kick him off from the bed, and
never will let him come near it; for of late, indeed, (I do
not know what's the reason,) I don't much care for my
shock-dog, nor my babies.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> O then, miss, I may have hopes! for after the
shock-dog and the babies, 'tis the man's turn to be
beloved.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, could you be so good-natured as to come
after my shock-dog in my love? it may be, indeed,
rather than after one of your brother men.</p>

<p><i>Ger</i> Hah, ha, ha! poor creature! a wonder of innocency!
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I see you are humble, because you would
kiss my hand.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, I am ambitious therefore.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, all this fooling but loses time, I
must make better use of it. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.] I could let
you kiss my hand, but then I'm afraid you would take
hold of me and carry me away.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Indeed I would not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come, I know you would.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Truly I would not.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You would! you would! I know you would.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I'll swear I wo' not&mdash;by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, don't swear, for you'll be the apter to do it
then. [<i>Aside.</i>] I would not have him forswear it neither;&mdash;he
does not like me, sure, well enough to carry me
away.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Dear miss, let me kiss your hand.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I am sure you would carry me away if I should.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Be not afraid of it.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Nay, I am afraid of the contrary.&mdash;Either
he dislikes me, and therefore will not be troubled
with me, or what is as bad, he loves me and is dull, or
fearful to displease me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Trust me, sweetest! I can use no violence to
you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, I am sure you would carry me away; what
should you come in at the window for, if you did not
mean to steal me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> If I should endeavour it, you might cry out, and I
should be prevented.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Dull, dull man of the town! are all like
thee? He is as dull as a country squire at questions and
commands.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.] No, if I should cry out never
so loud, this is quite at the further end of the house, and
there nobody could hear me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I will not give you the occasion, dearest.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, I will quicken thy sense, if it be
possible.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.] Nay, I know you come to
steal me away; because I am an heiress, and have twelve
hundred pounds a year, lately left me by my mother's
brother, which my father cannot meddle with, and which
is the chiefest reason (I suppose) why he keeps me up so
close.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So!&mdash;this has made him consider. O money!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
powerful money! how the ugly, old, crooked, straight,
handsome young women are beholding to thee! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Twelve hundred pounds a year!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Besides, I have been told my fortune, and the
woman said I should be stolen away, because she says
'tis the fate of heiresses to be stolen away.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Twelve hundred pounds a-year!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, more, she described the man to me that
was to do it, and he was as like you as could be. Have
you any brothers?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Not any; 'twas I, I warrant you, sweetest.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So, he understands himself now. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, madam, since 'twas foretold you, what
do you think on't? 'tis in vain, you know, to resist
fate.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I do know, indeed, they say 'tis to no purpose:
besides, the woman that told me my fortune, or you,
have bewitched me&mdash;Ih&mdash;think. [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> My soul! my life! 'tis you have charms powerful
as numberless, especially those of your innocency
irresistible, and do surprise the wariest heart. Such mine
was, while I could call it mine, but now 'tis yours for
ever.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, well, get you gone then. I'll keep it safe
for your sake.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, you must go with me, sweetest.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, I see you will part with the jewel; but
you will have the keeping of the cabinet to which you
commit it.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, come, my dearest, let us be gone: Fortune
as well as women must be taken in the humour.</p>

<p class="center"><i>As they are going out</i>, <span class="smcap">Prue</span> <i>runs hastily to them.</i></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> O miss, miss! your father, it seems, is just now
arrived, and is here coming in upon you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My father.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> My daughter and a man!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> A man! a man in the house!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Ha! what mean these?&mdash;a Spaniard!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What shall I do? Stay&mdash;Nay, pray stir not from
me; but lead me about, as if you led me a corant.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
[<i>Leads her about.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Is this your government, sister? and this your
innocent charge, that hath not seen the face of a man
this twelvemonth? <i>en hora mala!</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> O, sure, it is not a man! it cannot be a
man! [<i>Puts on her spectacles.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> It cannot be a man! if he be not a man, he's a
devil. He has her lovingly by the hand too, <i>valgame el
cielo!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Do not seem to mind them, but dance on, or
lead me about still.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> What d'ye mean by it? [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Hey, they are frolic, a-dancing!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Indeed, they are dancing, I think.&mdash;Why,
niece!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, hold a little: I'll make 'em dance in the
devil's name; but it shall not be <i>la gallarda</i>.
[<i>Draws his sword.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> O niece! why niece!
[Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span> <i>holds him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Do you hear her? what do you mean?
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Take no notice of them; but walk about still,
and sing a little, sing a corant.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I can't sing: but I'll hum, if you will.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Are you so merry? well I'll be with you: <i>en
hora mala!</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> O niece, niece! why niece! oh&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

my ruin! my plague!
[<i>Struggling, gets from</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>, <i>goes towards
them with his sword drawn.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Mind him not, but dance and sing on.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> A pretty time to dance and sing, indeed, when I
have a Spaniard with a naked Toledo at my tail! No,
pray excuse me, miss, from fooling any longer.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Turning about.</i>] O, my father, my father!
poor father! you are welcome; pray give me your
blessing.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> My blessing, <i>en hora mala!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What! am I not your daughter, sir?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> My daughter! <i>mi mal! mi muerte!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My name's Hippolita, sir: I don't own your
Spanish names. But, pray father, why do you frighten
one so? you know I don't love to see a sword: what do
you mean to do with that ugly thing out?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I'll show you. <i>Traidor! ladron de mi honra!</i>
thou diest. [<i>Runs at</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Not if I can help it, good Don. But by the
names you give me, I find you mistake your man: I
suppose some Spaniard has affronted you. [<i>Draws.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> None but thee, <i>ladron!</i> and thou diest for't.
[<i>Fight.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Oh! oh! oh!&mdash;help! help! help!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> O&mdash;what, will you kill my poor dancing-master?
[<i>Kneels.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> A dancing-master! he's a fencing-master rather,
I think. But is he your dancing-master? umph&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So much wit and innocency were never together
before. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Is he a dancing-master? [<i>Pausing.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Is he a dancing-master? He does not
look like a dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Pish!&mdash;you don't know a dancing-master: you
have not seen one these threescore years, I warrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No matter: but he does not look like a
dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, nay, dancing-masters look like gentlemen
enough, sister: but he's no dancing-master, by drawing
a sword so briskly. Those tripping outsides of gentlemen
are like gentlemen enough in everything but in
drawing a sword; and since he is a gentleman, he shall
die by mine. [<i>They fight again.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Oh! hold! hold!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Hold! hold!&mdash;Pray, brother, let's talk with
him a little first; I warrant you I shall trap him; and if
he confesses, you may kill him; but those that confess,
they say, ought to be hanged&mdash;Let's see&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Poor Hippolita! I wish I had not had this
occasion of admiring thy wit; I have increased my love,
whilst I have lost my hopes; the common fate of poor
lovers. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Come, you are guilty, by that hanging
down of your head. Speak: are you a dancing-master?
Speak, speak; a dancing-master?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, forsooth, I am a dancing-master; ay, ay&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How does it appear?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, there is his fiddle, there upon the table,
father.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, busybody, but it is not:&mdash;that is my
nephew's fiddle.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, he lent it to my cousin: I tell you it is
his.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, it may be, indeed; he might lend it
to him for aught I know.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ay, ay: but ask him, sister, if he be a dancing-master,
where.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Pray, brother, let me alone with him, I
know what to ask him, sure.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What, will you be wiser than I? nay, then stand
away. Come, if you are a dancing-master, where's your
school? <i>Donde? donde?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Why, he'll say, may be, he has ne'er a one.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Who asked you, nimble chaps? So you have put
an excuse in his head.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Indeed, sir, 'tis no excuse: I have no school.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well; but who sent you? how came you
hither?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> There I am puzzled indeed. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> How came you hither, I say? how&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Why, how, how should I come hither?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ay, how should he come hither? Upon his legs.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> So, so! now you have put an excuse in his
head too, that you have, so you have; but stay&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, with your favour, mistress, I'll ask him now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Y'facks, but you shan't! I'll ask him, and
ask you no favour, that I will.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Y'fackins, but you shan't ask him! if you go
there too, look you, you prattle-box you, I'll ask him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I will ask him, I say!&mdash;come!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Where?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> What!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Mine's a shrewd question.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Mine's as shrewd as yours.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, then, we shall have it.&mdash;Come, answer me;
where's your lodging? come, come, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> A shrewd question, indeed! at the Surgeons'-arms,
I warrant you; for 'tis spring-time, you
know.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Must you make lies for him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> But come, sir; what's your name?&mdash;answer
me to that; come.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> His name! why, 'tis an easy matter to tell you a
false name, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> So! must you teach him to cheat us?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Why did you say my questions were not shrewd
questions, then?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> And why would you not let me ask him
the question, then? Brother, brother, ever while you live,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
for all your Spanish wisdom, let an old woman make discoveries:
the young fellows cannot cheat us in anything,
I'd have you to know. Set your old woman still to
grope out an intrigue, because, you know, the mother
found her daughter in the oven. A word to the wise,
brother.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, leave this tattling: he has dishonoured
my family, debauched my daughter; and what
if he could excuse himself? The Spanish proverb says,
excuses neither satisfy creditors nor the injured. The
wounds of honour must have blood and wounds, <i>St. Jago
para mi!</i>
[<i>Kisses the cross of his sword, and runs at</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> O hold, dear father! and I'll confess all.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> She will not, sure, after all. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My cousin sent him; because, as he said,
he would have me recover my dancing a little before
our wedding, having made a vow he would never marry a
wife who could not dance a corant. I am sure I was
unwilling; but he would have him come, saying I was to
be his wife as soon as you came, and therefore expected
obedience from me.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Indeed, the venture is most his, and the shame
would be most his; for I know here in England, 'tis not
the custom for the father to be much concerned what the
daughter does; but I will be a Spaniard still.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Did not you hear him say last night he would
send me one this morning?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, not I, sure. If I had, he had never
come here.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, aunt, you grow old I see; your memory
fails you very much. Did not you hear him, Prue, say
he would send him to me?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Yes, I'll be sworn did I.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Look you there, aunt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I wonder I should not remember it.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, you are a doting old fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> So! So! the fault will be mine now. But
pray, mistress, how did he come in? I am sure I had the
keys of the doors, which, till your father came in, were
not opened to-day.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> He came in just after my father, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> It might be, indeed, while the porters
brought in the things, and I was talking with you.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> O, might he so, forsooth! you are a brave
governante! Look you, you a duenna, <i>voto!</i>&mdash;and not
know who comes in and out!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut</i> So! 'tis my fault, I know.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Your maid was in the room with you; was she
not, child?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, indeed, and indeed, father, all the while.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, child, I am satisfied then.&mdash;But I hope he
does not use the dancing-master's tricks, of squeezing
your hands, setting your legs and feet, by handling your
thighs and seeing your legs.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, indeed, father: I'd give him a box on the
ear if he should.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Poor innocent!&mdash;Well, I am contented you
should learn to dance, since, for aught I know, you shall
be married to-morrow, or the next day at farthest: by
that time you may recover a corant&mdash;a saraband I would
say.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> And since your cousin, too, will have a dancing
wife, it shall be so; and I'll see you dance myself. You
shall be my charge these two days, and then I dare venture
you in the hand of any dancing-master, even a saucy
French dancing-master, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well, have a care, though; for this man is
not dressed like a dancing master.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Go, go, you dote; are they not (for the most
part) better dressed and prouder than many a good
gentleman? you would be wiser than I, would you,
<i>cuerno</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well, I say only, look to't, look to't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Hey, hey! Come, friend, to your business;
teach her her lesson over again; let's see.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come, master.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, let's see your English method; I
understand something of dancing myself&mdash;come.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come, master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I shall betray you yet, dearest miss; for I know
not a step: I could never dance. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, child.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed I'm ashamed, father.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You must not be ashamed, child; you'll never
dance well if you are ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, I can't help it, father.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, I say, go to't.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed I can't, father, before you: 'tis my first
lesson, and I shall do it so ill.&mdash;Pray, good father, go
into the next room for this once; and the next time
my master comes, you shall see I shall be confident
enough.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Poor, foolish, innocent creature!&mdash;Well, well, I
will, child. Who but a Spanish kind of a father could
have so innocent a daughter in England?&mdash;Well, I would
fain see any one steal or debauch my daughter from
me.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, won't you go, father?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Yes, yes, I go, child: we will all go but your
maid.&mdash;You can dance before your maid?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, yes, father: a maid at most times with her
mistress is nobody. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Diego</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> He peeps yet at the door.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, father, you peep; indeed you must not see
me. When we have done, you shall come in.
[<i>She pulls the door to.</i></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Indeed, little mistress, like the young kitten,
you see you played with your prey till you had almost
lost it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis true, a good old mouser like you had taken
it up, and run away with it presently.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Let me adore you, dearest miss, and give you&mdash;[<i>Going
to embrace her.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, no embracing, good master! that ought to
be the last lesson you are to teach me, I have heard.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Though an aftergame be the more tedious and
dangerous, 'tis won, miss, with the more honour and
pleasure: for all that, I repent we were put to't. The
coming in of your father, as he did, was the most unlucky
thing that ever befel me.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What then, you think I would have gone with
you?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes; and you will go with me yet, I hope.&mdash;Courage,
miss! we have yet an opportunity; and the
gallery-window is yet open.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, no; if I went, I would go for good and all:
but now my father will soon come in again, and may
quickly overtake us. Besides, now I think on't, you are
a stranger to me; I know not where you live, nor
whither you might carry me. For aught I know, you
might be a spirit, and carry me to Barbadoes.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, dear miss, I would carry you to court, the
playhouses, and Hyde-park&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, I know 'tis the trick of all you that spirit
women away, to speak 'em mighty fair at first: but
when you have got 'em in your clutches, you carry 'em
into Yorkshire, Wales, or Cornwall, which is as bad as to
Barbadoes; and rather than be served so, I would be a
prisoner in London still as I am.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I see the air of this town, without the pleasures
of it, is enough to infect women with an aversion for the
country. Well, miss, since it seems you have some
diffidence in me, give me leave to visit you as your
dancing-master, now you have honoured me with the
character; and under that I may have your father's
permission to see you, till you may better know me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and my heart, and have a better opportunity to reward
it.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I am afraid to know your heart would require a
great deal of time; and my father intends to marry me
very suddenly to my cousin, who sent you hither.</p>

<p><i>Get.</i> Pray, sweet miss, let us make the better use of
our time if it be short. But how shall we do with that
cousin of yours in the mean time? we must needs charm
him.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Leave that to me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But (what's worse) how shall I be able to act
a dancing-master, who ever wanted inclination and
patience to learn myself?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> A dancing-school in half an hour will furnish
you with terms of the art. Besides, Love (as I have
heard say) supplies his scholars with all sorts of capacities
they have need of, in spite of nature:&mdash;but what has love
to do with you?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Love, indeed, has made a grave gouty statesmen
fight duels, the soldier fly from his colours, a pedant a
fine gentlemen, nay, and the very lawyer a poet; and,
therefore, may make me a dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> If he were your master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I'm sure, dearest miss, there is nothing else
which I cannot do for you already; and, therefore, may
hope to succeed in that.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, have you done?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> O, my father again!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, now let us see you dance.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed I am not perfect yet: pray excuse me
till the next time my master comes. But when must he
come again, father?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Let me see&mdash;friend, you must needs come after
dinner again, and then at night again, and so three times
to-morrow too. If she be not married to-morrow, (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
I am to consider of,) she will dance a corant in twice or
thrice teaching more; will she not? for 'tis but a twelvemonth
since she came from Hackney-school.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> We will lose no time, I warrant you, sir, if she be
to be married to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> True, I think she may be married to-morrow;
therefore, I would not have you lose any time, look you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> You need not caution me, I warrant you, sir.&mdash;Sweet
scholar, your humble servant: I will not fail you
immediately after dinner.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, no, pray do not; and I will not fail to satisfy
you very well, look you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> He does not doubt his reward, father, for his
pains. If you should not, I would make that good to
him.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, let us go in to your aunt: I must talk
with you both together, child.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I follow you, sir.

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;Don <span class="smcap">Diego's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Monsieur de <span class="smcap">Paris, Hippolita</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Serviteur, serviteur, la cousine.</i>
Your maid told me she watched at the
stair-foot for my coming; because you
had a mind to speak wit me before I
saw your fader, it seem.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I would so, indeed, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Or-ça! or-ça!</i> I know your affair. It is to tell
me wat recreation you ade with Monsieur Gerrard.
But did he come? I was afrait he would not come.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, yes, he did come.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;and were you not infiniment
divertisee and please? Confess.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I was indeed, cousin, I was very well pleased.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I do tinke so. I did tinke to come and be
divertisee myself this morning with the sight of his reception:
but I did rancounter last night wit dam company
dat keep me up so late, I could not rise in de morning,
<i>malepeste de putains!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, we wanted you here mightily, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> To elpe you to laugh: for if I adde been here,
I had made such recreation wit dat coxcomb Gerrard!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, cousin, you need not have any subject
property to make one laugh, you are so pleasant yourself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and when you are but alone, you would make one
burst.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Am I so happy, cousin, then, in the <i>bon</i> quality
of making people laugh?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Mighty happy, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Mons. De grace?</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, <i>sans vanité</i>, I observe, wheresoe'er I
come, I make everybody merry; <i>sans vanité</i>&mdash;da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I do believe you do.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, as I marche in de street, I can make de
dull apprenty laugh and sneer.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> This fool, I see, is as apt as an ill poet to mistake
the contempt and scorn of people for applause and
admiration. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ah, cousin, you see what it is to have been in
France! Before I went into France, I could get nobody
to laugh at me, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No? truly, cousin, I think you deserved it before;
but you are improved, indeed, by going into
France.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, the French education make us <i>propre
à tout</i>. Beside, cousin, you must know, to play the
fool is the science in France, and I didde go to the
Italian academy at Paris thrice a-week to learn to play
de fool of Signior Scaramouche,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> who is the most
excellent personage in the world for dat noble science.
Angel is a dam English fool to him.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Methinks, now, Angel is a very good fool.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Naugh, naugh, Nokes is a better fool; but
indeed the Englis are not fit to be fools: here are ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
few good fools. 'Tis true, you have many a young
cavalier who go over into France to learn to be de
buffoon; but for all dat, dey return but <i>mauvais</i> buffoon,
<i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I'm sure, cousin, you have lost no time there.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh, <i>le brave</i> Scaramouche!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But is it a science in France, cousin? and is
there an academy for fooling? sure none go to it but
players.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Dey are comedians dat are de <i>maîtres</i>; but all
the <i>beau monde</i> go to learn, as they do here of Angel and
Nokes. For if you did go abroad into company, you
would find the best almost of de nation conning in all
places the lessons which dey have learned of the fools
dere <i>maîtres</i>, Nokes and Angel.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Yes, yes, dey are de <i>gens de qualité</i> that practise
dat science most, and the most <i>ambitieux</i>; for fools and
buffoons have been always most welcome to courts, and
desired in all companies. Auh, to be de fool, de buffoon,
is to be de great personage.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Fools have fortune, they say, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> So say old Senèque.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, cousin, not to make you proud, you are
the greatest fool in England, I am sure.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non, de grace; non:</i> Nokes de comedian
is a pretty man, a pretty man for a comedian, da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You are modest, cousin.&mdash;But lest my father
should come in presently, which he will do as soon as he
knows you are here, I must give you a caution, which 'tis
fit you should have before you see him.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Vell, vell, cousin, vat is dat?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You must know, then (as commonly the conclusion
of all mirth is sad), after I had a good while
pleased myself in jesting, and leading the poor gentleman
you sent into a fool's paradise, and almost made him
believe I would go away with him, my father, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
home this morning, came in upon us, and caught him
with me.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Malepeste!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And drew his sword upon him, and would have
killed him; for you know my father's Spanish fierceness
and jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But how did he come off then, <i>tête non?</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> In short, I was fain to bring him off by saying he
was my dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! ver good jeste.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I was unwilling to have the poor man killed, you
know, for our foolish frolic with him: but then, upon my
aunt's and father's inquiry, how he came in, and who sent
him, I was forced to say you did, desiring I should be
able to dance a corant before our wedding.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> A ver good jest&mdash;da&mdash;still better as better.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Now, all that I am to desire of you is, to own
you sent him, that I may not be caught in a lie.</p>

<p><i>Mons</i> Yes, yes, a ver good jest: Gerrard a <i>maître de
danse!</i> ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, the jest is like to be better yet; for my
father himself has obliged him now to come and teach
me: so that now he must take the dancing-master upon
him, and come three or four times to me before our
wedding, lest my father, if he should come no more,
should be suspicious I had told him a lie. And, for
aught I know, if he should know, or but guess he were
not a dancing-master, in his Spanish strictness and
punctilios of honour, he might kill me as the shame and
stain of his honour and family, which he talks of so
much. Now, you know the jealous cruel fathers in
Spain serve their poor innocent daughters often so; and
he is more than a Spaniard.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Non, non,</i> fear noting; I warrant you, he shall
come as often as you will to de house; and your father
shall never know who he is till we are married. But
then I'll tell him all for the jest's sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But will you keep my counsel, dear cousin, till
we are married?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Poor dear fool! I warrant thee, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, what a fool am I indeed! for you would not
have me killed. You love me too well, sure, to be an
instrument of my death.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span>, <i>walking gravely, a</i> Black boy <i>behind
him; and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p>But here comes my father, remember.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I would no more tell him of it than I would tell
you if I had been with a wench, <i>jarni!</i> [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;She's
afraid to be killed, poor wretch, and he's a capricious,
jealous fop enough to do't:&mdash;but here he comes.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.] I'll keep thy counsel, I warrant thee, my
dear soul, <i>mon petit c&#339;ur.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Peace! peace! my father's coming this way.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, but by his march he won't be near enough
to hear us this half hour, ha! ha! ha!
[Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span> <i>walks leisurely round</i> Monsieur, <i>surveying
him, and shrugging up his shoulders,
whilst</i> Monsieur <i>makes legs and faces aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Is that thing my cousin, sister?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> 'Tis he, sir.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Cousin, I am sorry to see you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Is that a Spanish compliment?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> So much disguised, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Oh! is it out at last, <i>ventre?</i>&mdash;[<i>To</i>
Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span>.]&mdash;<i>Serviteur, serviteur, à monsieur mon oncle;</i>
and I am glad to see you here within doors, most
Spanish <i>oncle</i>, ha! ha! ha! but I should be sorry to see
you in the streets, <i>tête non!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Why so?&mdash;would you be ashamed of me, hah&mdash;<i>voto
á St. Jago!</i> would you? hauh&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay; it may be you would be ashamed yourself,
<i>monsieur mon oncle</i>, of the great train you would get to
wait upon your Spanish hose, puh&mdash;the boys would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
follow you, and hoot at you&mdash;<i>vert</i> and <i>bleu!</i> pardon my
Franch <i>franchise, monsieur mon oncle.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> We shall have sport anon, betwixt these two
contraries. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Dost thou call me "monsieur?" <i>voto á St. Jago!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, I did not call you Monsieur Voto á St.
Jago! Sir, I know you are my uncle, Mr. James Formal&mdash;da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But I can hardly know you are my cousin, Mr.
Nathaniel Paris.&mdash;But call me, sir, Don Diego henceforward,
look you, and no monsieur. Call me monsieur!
<i>guarda!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I confess my error, sir; for none but a blind
man would call you monsieur, ha! ha!&mdash;But, pray, do
not call me neder Paris, but de Paris, de Paris, (<i>s'il vous
plait,</i>) Monsieur de Paris. Call me monsieur, and
welcome, da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Monsieur de Pantaloons then, <i>voto</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Monsieur de Pantaloons! a pretty name, a
pretty name, <i>ma foi!</i> da&mdash;<i>bien trouvé</i> de Pantaloons!
how much better den your de la Fountaines, de la
Rivieres, de la Roches, and all the <i>de's</i> in France&mdash;da&mdash;well;
but have you not the admiration for my
pantaloon, Don Diego, <i>mon oncle?</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I am astonished at them, <i>verdaderamente</i>, they
are wonderfully ridiculous.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Redicule! redicule! ah&mdash;'tis well you are my
uncle, da&mdash;redicule! ha&mdash;is dere any ting in the universe
so <i>gentil</i> as de pantaloons? any ting so <i>ravissant</i> as de
pantaloons? Auh&mdash;I could kneel down and varship
a pair of <i>gentil</i> pantaloons. Vat, vat, you would have me
have de admiration for dis outward skin of your thigh,
which you call Spanish hose, fi! fi! fi!&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Dost thou deride my Spanish hose, young man,
hauh?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> In comparison of pantaloon, I do undervalue
'em indeed, Don Diego, <i>mon oncle</i>, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Thou art then a <i>gabacho<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> de mal gusto</i>, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> You may call me vat you vill, <i>oncle</i> Don
Diego; but I must needs say, your Spanish hose are
scurvy hose, ugly hose, lousy hose, and stinking hose.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Do not provoke me, <i>borracho!</i>
[<i>Puts his hand to his sword.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Indeet, as for lousy, I recant dat epithete, for
dere is scarce room in 'em for dat little animal, ha! ha!
ha! but for stinking hose, dat epithete may stand; for
how can they choose but stink, since they are so
<i>furieusement</i> close to your Spanish tail, da?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ha! ha! ridiculous! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Do not provoke me, I say, <i>en hora mala!</i>
[<i>Seems to draw.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, <i>oncle</i>, I am sorry you are in de pation;
but I must live and die for de pantaloon against de
Spanish hose, da.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You are a rash young man; and while you wear
pantaloons, you are beneath my passion, <i>voto</i>&mdash;auh&mdash;they
make thee look and waddle (with all those gewgaw
ribbons) like a great, old, fat, slovenly water dog.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And your Spanish hose, and your nose in the
air, make you look like a great, grizzled, long Irish greyhound
reaching a crust off from a high shelf, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Don. Bueno! bueno!</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> What, have you a mind to ruin yourself
and break off the match?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pshaw&mdash;wat do you tell me of the matche! d'ye
tinke I will not vindicate pantaloons, <i>morbleu!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, he is a lost young man, I see, and
desperately far gone in the epidemic malady of our
nation, the affectation of the worst of French vanities:
but I must be wiser than him, as I am a Spaniard.
Look you, Don Diego, and endeavour to reclaim him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
art and fair means, look you, Don Diego; if not, he
shall never marry my daughter, look you, Don
Diego, though he be my own sister's son, and has two
thousand five hundred seventy-three pounds sterling,
twelve shillings and twopence a year pennyrent, <i>seguramente!</i>&mdash;[<i>To</i>
Monsieur.] Come, young man, since you
are so obstinate, we will refer our difference to arbitration;
your mistress, my daughter, shall be umpire betwixt us,
concerning Spanish hose and pantaloons.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pantaloons and Spanish hose, <i>s'il vous plait</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Your mistress is the fittest judge of your dress, sure.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I know ver vel dat most of the <i>jeunesse</i> of
England will not change de ribband upon de crevat
without de consultation of dere <i>maîtresse</i>; but I am no
<i>Anglais</i>, da&mdash;nor shall I make de reference of my dress
to any in the universe, da&mdash;I judge by any in England!
<i>tête non!</i> I would not be judge by any English looking-glass,
<i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Be not <i>positivo</i>, young man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, pray refer it, cousin, pray do.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Non, non, your servant, your servant, aunt.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But, pray, be not so positive. Come hither,
daughter, tell me which is best.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, father, you have kept me in universal
ignorance, I know nothing.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And do you tink I shall refer an affair of that
consequence to a poor young ting who have not seen the
vorld, da? I am wiser than so, <i>voto!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, in short, if you will not be wiser, and leave
off your French dress, stammering, and tricks, look you,
you shall be a fool, and go without my daughter, <i>voto!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How! must I leave off my jantee French
accoutrements, and speak base Englis too, or not marry
my cousin, <i>mon oncle</i> Don Diego? Do not break
off the match, do not; for know, I will not leave off my
pantaloon and French pronuntiation for ne'er a cousin in
England't, da.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I tell you again, he that marries my daughter
shall at least look like a wise man, for he shall wear the
Spanish habit; I am a Spanish <i>positivo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ver vel! ver vel! and I am a French <i>positivo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Then I am <i>definitivo</i>; and if you do not go
immediately into your chamber, and put on a Spanish
habit, I have brought over on purpose for your wedding-clothes,
and put off all these French fopperies and
<i>vanidades</i>, with all your grimaces, agreeables, adorables,
<i>ma fois</i>, and <i>jarnis</i>; I swear you shall never marry my
daughter (and by an oath by Spaniard never broken) by
my whiskers and snuff-box!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> O hold! do not swear, uncle, for I love your
daughter <i>furieusement</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> If you love her, you'll obey me.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh, wat will become of me! but have the
consideration. Must I leave off all the Franch <i>beautés</i>,
graces, and embellisments, bote of my person, and
language?
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>,
<i>laughing.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I will have it so.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I am ruinne den, undonne. Have some consideration
for me, for dere is not de least ribbon of my
<i>garniture</i> but is as dear to me as your daughter, <i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Then, you do not deserve her; and for that
reason I will be satisfied you love her better, or you shall
not have her, for I am <i>positivo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Vill you break mine arte? Pray have de consideration
for me.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I say again, you shall be dressed before night
from top to toe in the Spanish habit, or you shall never

<p><i>Mons.</i> Will you not so mush as allow me one little
French oate?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, you shall look like a Spaniard, but speak
and swear like an Englishman, look you.</p>

this <i>cavaliero</i> into his chamber with those things I ordered
you to take out of the trunks.&mdash;I would have you a little
accustomed to your clothes before your wedding; for, if
you comply with me, you shall marry my daughter to-morrow,

sword! dear peruke! and dear <i>chapeau retroussé</i>, and
dear shoe, <i>jarni!</i> adieu! adieu! adieu! <i>Hélas!
hélas! hélas!</i> will you have yet no pity?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I am a Spanish <i>positivo</i>, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> And more cruel than de Spanish inquisitiono,
to compel a man to a habit against his conscience;

<p><i>Prue.</i> Here's the dancing-master, shall I call my
mistress, sir?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Yes.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.] O, you are as punctual
as a Spaniard: I love your punctual men; nay, I think
'tis before your time something.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, I am resolved your daughter, sir, shall lose
no time by my fault.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> So, so, 'tis well.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I were a very unworthy man, if I should not be
punctual with her, sir.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You speak honestly, very honestly, friend; and
I believe a very honest man, though a dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I am very glad you think me so, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What, you are but a young man, are you married
yet?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, sir; but I hope I shall, sir, very suddenly,
if things hit right.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What, the old folks her friends are wary, and
cannot agree with you so soon as the daughter can?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, sir, the father hinders it a little at present;
but the daughter, I hope, is resolved, and then we shall
do well enough.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! you do not steal her, according to the
laudable custom of some of your brother dancing-masters?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, no, sir; steal her, sir! steal her! you are
pleased to be merry, sir, ha! ha! ha!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I cannot
but laugh at that question.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, sir, methinks you are pleased to be merry,
but you say the father does not consent?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Not yet, sir; but 'twill be no matter whether he
does or no.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Was she one of your scholars? if she were, 'tis a
hundred to ten but you steal her.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I shall not be able to hold laughing.
[<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, nay, I find by your laughing you steal her:
she was your scholar; was she not?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, sir, she was the first I ever had, and may be
the last too; for she has a fortune (if I can get her) will
keep me from teaching to dance any more.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> So, so, then she is your scholar still it seems,
and she has a good portion; I'm glad on't; nay, I knew
you stole her.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] My laughing may give him suspicions,
yet I cannot hold. [<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! you laugh, I warrant, to think how the
young baggage and you will mump the poor old father!
but if all her dependence for a fortune be upon the
father, he may chance to mump you both and spoil the
jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I hope it will not be in his power, sir, ha! ha!
ha!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I shall laugh too much anon.&mdash;[<i>To</i> Don
<span class="smcap">Diego</span>.] Pray, sir, be pleased to call for your daughter, I
am impatient till she comes, for time was never more
precious with me, and with her too; it ought to be so,
sure, since you say she is to be married to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> She ought to bestir her, as you say, indeed. Wuh,
daughter! daughter! Prue! Hippolita! come away,
child, why do you stay so long? [<i>Calls at the door.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita, Prue</span>, <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Your servant, master; indeed I am ashamed you
have stayed for me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> O, good madam, 'tis my duty; I know you came
as soon as you could.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I knew my father was with you, therefore I did
not make altogether so much haste as I might; but if
you had been alone, nothing should have kept me from
you. I would not have been so rude as to have made
you stay a minute for me, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, fiddle faddle, what a deal of ceremony
there is betwixt your dancing-master and you, <i>cuerno!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Lord, sir! I hope you'll allow me to show my
respect to my master, for I have a great respect for my
master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And I am very proud of my scholar, and am a
very great honourer of my scholar.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, friend, about your business, and
honour the king.&mdash;[<i>To</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.] Your dancing-masters
and barbers are such finical, smooth-tongued,
tattling fellows; and if you set 'em once a-talking, they'll
ne'er a-done, no more than when you set 'em a-fiddling:
indeed, all that deal with fiddles are given to impertinency.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well, well, this is an impertinent fellow,
without being a dancing-master. He is no more a
dancing-master than I am a maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! will you still be wiser than I? <i>voto!</i>&mdash;Come,
come, about with my daughter, man.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> So he would, I warrant you, if your worship
would let him alone.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How now, Mrs. Nimblechaps!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, though I have got a little canting at the
dancing-school since I was here, yet I do all so bunglingly,
he'll discover me. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Try.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come take my hand,
master.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Look you, brother, the impudent harlotry
gives him her hand.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Can he dance with her without holding her by
the hand?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Here, take my hand, master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I wish it were for good and all. [<i>Aside to her.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You dancing-masters are always so hasty, so
nimble.</p>

<p><i>Don. Voto á St. Jago!</i> not that I see; about with her,
man.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Indeed, sir, I cannot about with her as I would
do, unless you will please to go out a little, sir; for I see
she is bashful still before you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Hey, hey, more fooling yet! come, come, about,
about with her.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, indeed, father, I am ashamed, and cannot
help it.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But you shall help it, for I will not stir. Move
her, I say.&mdash;Begin, hussy, move when he'll have you.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> I cannot but laugh at that, ha! ha! ha! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.] Come, then, madam, since
it must be so, let us try; but I shall discover all.&mdash;One,
two, and coupee.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, d'ye see how he squeezes her hand,
brother! O the lewd villain!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, move, I say, and mind her not.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> One, two, three, four, and turn round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> D'ye see again? he took her by the bare
arm.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, move on, she's mad.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> One, two, and a coupee.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, one, two, and turn out your toes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> There, there, he pinched her by the thigh:
will you suffer it?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> One, two, three, and fall back.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Fall back, fall back, back; some of you are forward
enough to back.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Back, madam.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Fall back, when he bids you, hussy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> How! how! fall back, fall back! marry,
but she shall not fall back when he bids her.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I say she shall.&mdash;Huswife, come.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> She will, she will, I warrant you, sir, if you won't
be angry with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Do you know what he means by that now?
You a Spaniard!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How's that? I not a Spaniard! say such a
word again&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come forward, madam, three steps again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> See, see, she squeezes his hand now: O
the debauched harlotry!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> So, so, mind her not; she moves forward pretty
well; but you must move as well backward as forward,
or you'll never do anything to purpose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Do you know what you say, brother,
yourself, now? are you at your beastliness before your
young daughter?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How now, mistress, are you so merry?&mdash;Is this
your staid maid as you call her, sister Impertinent?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I have not much to say to you, miss; but I shall
not have an opportunity to do it, unless we can get your
father out. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, about again with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Look you there, she squeezes his hand
hard again.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, and indeed, father, my aunt puts
me quite out: I cannot dance while she looks on
for my heart, she makes me ashamed and afraid together.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Indeed, if you would please to take her out, sir, I
am sure I should make my scholar do better, than when
you are present, sir. Pray, sir, be pleased for this time
to take her away; for the next time, I hope I shall
order it so, we shall trouble neither of you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, no, brother, stir not, they have a mind
to be left alone. Come, there's a beastly trick in't; he's
no dancing-master, I tell you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Damned jade! she'll discover us.
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What, will you teach me? nay, then I will go
out, and you shall go out too, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I will not go out, look you.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, thou art a censorious wicked
woman, and you shall disturb them no longer.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> What! will you bawd for your daughter?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ay, ay; come go out, out, out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I will not go out, I will not go out; my
conscience will not suffer me, for I know by experience
what will follow.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I warrant you, sir, we'll make good use of our
time when you are gone.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Do you hear him again? don't you know
what he means?
[<i>Exit</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span> <i>thrusting</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span> <i>out.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis very well!&mdash;you are a fine gentleman to
abuse my poor father so.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> 'Tis but by your example, miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, I am his daughter, and may make the
bolder with him, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And I am his son-in-law, that shall be; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
therefore may claim my privilege too of making bold
with him, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Methinks you should be contented in making
bold with his daughter (for you have made very bold
with her) sure.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I hope I shall make bolder with her yet.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I do not doubt your confidence, for you are a
dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Why, miss, I hope you would not have me a fine,
senseless, whining, modest lover; for modesty in a man
is as ill as the want of it in a woman.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I thank you for that, sir, now you have made
bold with me indeed; but if I am such a confident piece,
I am sure you made me so: if you had not had the
confidence to come in at the window, I had not had the
confidence to look upon a man: I am sure I could not
look upon a man before.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But that I humbly conceive, sweet miss, was
your father's fault, because you had not a man to look
upon. But, dearest miss, I do not think you confident,
you are only innocent; for that which would be called
confidence, nay impudence, in a woman of years, is called
innocency in one of your age; and the more impudent you
appear, the more innocent you are thought.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Say you so? has youth such privileges? I do not
wonder then, most women seem impudent, since it is to
be thought younger than they are, it seems. But indeed,
master, you are as great an encourager of impudence, I
see, as if you were a dancing-master in good earnest.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, yes, a young thing may do anything; may
leap out of the window and go away with her dancing
master, if she please.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So, so, the use follows the doctrine very suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, dearest, pray let us make the use we should
of it; lest your father should make too bold with us, and
come in before we would have him.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, old relations are apt to take that ill-bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
freedom of pressing into young company at unseasonable
hours.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, dear miss, let me tell you how I have designed
matters; for in talking of anything else we lose
time and opportunity. People abroad indeed say, the
English women are the worst in the world in using an
opportunity, they love tittle-tattle and ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis because, I warrant, opportunities are not so
scarce here as abroad, they have more here than they
can use; but let people abroad say what they will of
English women, because they do not know 'em, but what
say people at home?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Pretty innocent! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Well, I say you
will not make use of your opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I say, you have no reason to say so yet.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well then, anon at nine of the clock at night I'll
try you: for I have already bespoke a parson, and have
taken up the three back-rooms of the tavern, which front
upon the gallery-window, that nobody may see us escape;
and I have appointed (precisely betwixt eight and nine of
the clock when it is dark) a coach and six to wait at the
tavern-door for us.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> A coach and six! a coach and six, do you say?
nay, then I see you are resolved to carry me away; for a
coach and six, though there were not a man but the
coachman with it, would carry away any young girl of my
age in England:&mdash;a coach and six!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Then you will be sure to be ready to go with me?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What young woman of the town could ever say
no to a coach and six, unless it were going into the
country?&mdash;A coach and six! 'tis not in the power of
fourteen years old to resist it.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> You will be sure to be ready?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You are sure 'tis a coach and six?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I warrant you, miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I warrant you then they'll carry us merrily away:&mdash;a
coach and six!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But have you charmed your cousin the monsieur
(as you said you would) that he in the mean time say
nothing to prevent us?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span>; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span> <i>pressing in after

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I will come in.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, I hope by this time you have given her full
instructions; you have told her what and how to do,
you have done all.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> We have just done indeed, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay, sir, we have just done, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> And I fear just undone, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> D'ye hear that damned witch?
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, leave your censorious prating; thou hast
been a false, right woman thyself in thy youth, I warrant
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I right! I right! I scorn your words, I'd
have you to know, and 'tis well known. I right! no,
'tis your dainty minx, that Jillflirt, your daughter here,
that is right; do you see how her handkerchief is
ruffled, and what a heat she's in?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> She has been dancing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Ay, ay, Adam and Eve's dance, or the
beginning of the world; d'ye see how she pants?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> She has not been used to motion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Motion! motion! motion d'ye call it? no
indeed, I kept her from motion till now: motion with a
vengeance!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You put the poor bashful girl to the blush, you
see, hold your peace.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> 'Tis her guilt, not her modesty, marry!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, mind her not, child.&mdash;Come,
master, let me see her dance now the whole dance
roundly together; come, sing to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith; we shall be discovered after all; you
know I cannot sing a note, miss. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, man.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, father, my master's in haste now; pray
let it alone till anon at night, when, you say, he is to
come again, and then you shall see me dance it to the
violin; pray stay till then, father.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I will not be put off so; come, begin.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Pray, father.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, sing to her; come, begin.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Pray, sir, excuse me till anon, I am in some
haste.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I say, begin, I will not excuse you: come, take
her by the hand, and about with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I say, he shall not take her by the hand,
he shall touch her no more; while I am here, there
shall be no more squeezing and tickling her palm. Good
Mr. Dancing-master, stand off. [<i>Thrusts</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>away.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Get you out, Mrs. Impertinence.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.]
Take her by the hand, I say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Stand off, I say. He shall not touch her,
he has touched her too much already.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> If patience were not a Spanish virtue, I would
lay it aside now: I say, let 'em dance.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I say, they shall not dance.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Pray, father, since you see my aunt's obstinacy,
let us alone till anon, when you may keep her out.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well then, friend, do not fail to come.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, if he fail me at last&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Be sure you come, for she's to be married to-morrow:&mdash;do
you know it?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, yes, sir.&mdash;Sweet scholar, your humble
servant, till night; and think in the mean time of the
instructions I have given you, that you may be the
readier when I come.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ay, girl, be sure you do,&mdash;and do you be sure
to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> You need not be so concerned, he'll be
sure to come I warrant you; but if I could help it, he
should never set foot again in the house.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You would frighten the poor dancing-master
from the house,&mdash;but be sure you come for all her.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, sir.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] But this jade will pay me
when I am gone.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Hold, hold, sir, I must let you out, and I
wish I could keep you out. He a dancing-master! he's
a chouse, a cheat, a mere cheat, and that you'll find.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I find any man a cheat! I cheated by any man!
I scorn your words.&mdash;I that have so much Spanish care,
circumspection, and prudence, cheated by a man! Do
you think I, who have been in Spain, look you, and have
kept up my daughter a twelve month, for fear of being
cheated of her, look you? I cheated of her!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Well, say no more.

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, you may laugh, 'tis ver

I have deform myself into a ugly Spaniard.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, do you call this disguising yourself like a
Spaniard, while you wear pantaloons still, and the
cravat?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But is here not the double doublet, and the
Spanish dagger <i>aussi</i>?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But 'tis as long as the French sword, and worn
like it. But where's your Spanish beard, the thing of
most consequence?</p>

<p><i>Mons. Jarni!</i> do you tink beards are as easy to be
had as in the playhouses? non; but if here be no the
ugly long Spanish beard, here are, I am certain, the ugly
long Spanish ear.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why, <i>oncle</i>, you are at your <i>votos</i> still.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, I'll allow you to be at your <i>votos</i> too, but
not to make the incongruous match of Spanish doublet,

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, pray, dear <i>oncle</i>, let me unite France and
Spain; 'tis the mode of France now, <i>jarni, voto!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, I see I must pronounce: I told you, if you
were not dressed in the Spanish habit to-night, you
should not marry my daughter to-morrow, look you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well! am I not <i>habillé</i> in de Spanish habit?
my doublet, ear and hat, leg and feet, are Spanish, that
dey are.</p>

<p><i>Mons. Hélas! hélas! hélas!</i> dat <i>Espagne</i> should conquer
<i>la France</i> in England! <i>Hélas! hélas! hélas!</i> [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You see what pains I take to make him the
more agreeable to you, daughter.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But indeed, and indeed, father, you wash the
blackamoor white, in endeavouring to make a Spaniard
of a monsieur, nay, an English monsieur too; consider
that, father: for when once they have taken the French
<i>plie</i> (as they call it) they are never to be made so much
as Englishmen again, I have heard say.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! I warrant you are like the rest of the
young silly baggages of England, that like nothing but
what is French? You would not have him reformed,
you would have a monsieur to your husband, would you,
<i>cuerno</i>?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, indeed, father, I would not have a monsieur
to my husband; not I indeed: and I am sure you'll
never make my cousin otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You can't, you can't indeed, father: and you
have sworn, you know, he shall never have me, if he does
not leave off his monsieurship. Now, as I told you, 'tis
as hard for him to cease being a monsieur, as 'tis for you
to break a Spanish oath; so that I am not in any great
danger of having a monsieur to my husband.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, but you shall have him for your husband,
look you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Then you will break your Spanish oath.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, I will break him of his French tricks; and
you shall have him for your husband, <i>cuerno!</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed and indeed, father, I shall not have him.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Indeed you shall, daughter.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, you shall see, father.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> No, I warrant you, she will not have him,
she'll have her dancing-master rather: I know her meaning,
I understand her.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Thou malicious foolish woman! you understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
her!&mdash;But I do understand her; she says, I will not
break my oath, nor he his French customs; so, through
our difference, she thinks she shall not have him: but
she shall.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I shan't.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I know she will not have him, because she hates him.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I tell you, if she does hate him, 'tis a sign she
will have him for her husband; for 'tis not one of a thousand
that marries the man she loves, look you. Besides,
'tis all one whether she loves him now or not; for as soon
as she's married, she'd be sure to hate him. That's the
reason we wise Spaniards are jealous, and only expect,
nay, will be sure our wives shall fear us, look you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Pray, good father and aunt, do not dispute about
nothing; for I am sure he will never be my husband to
hate.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I am of your opinion, indeed; I understand
you. I can see as far as another.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You! you cannot see so much as through your
spectacles!&mdash;But I understand her: 'tis her mere desire
to marriage makes her say she shall not have him; for
your poor young things, when they are once in the teens,
think they shall never be married.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, father, think you what you will; but I know
what I think.</p>

[<i>The</i> Black <i>instructs</i> Monsieur <i>on one side of
the stage</i>, <span class="smcap">Prue</span> <i>standing on the other.</i></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> O the unfortunate condition of us poor chambermaids!
who have all the carking and caring, the watching
and sitting up, the trouble and danger of our mistresses'
intrigues, whilst they go away with all the
pleasure! And if they can get their man in a corner, 'tis
well enough; they ne'er think of the poor watchful
chambermaid, who sits knocking her heels in the cold,
for want of better exercise, in some melancholy lobby or
entry, when she could employ her time every whit as
well as her mistress, for all her quality, if she were but
put to't. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Black.</i> Hold up your head, hold up your head sir:&mdash;a
stooping Spaniard, <i>malo!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> True, a Spaniard scorns to look upon the
ground.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> We can shift for our mistresses, and not for
ourselves. Mine has got a handsome proper young man,
and is just going to make the most of him; whilst I must
be left in the lurch here with a couple of ugly little blackamoor
boys in bonnets, and an old withered Spanish
eunuch; not a servant else in the house, nor have I
hopes of any comfortable society at all. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Black.</i> Now let me see you make your visit-leg, thus.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Auh, <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Black.</i> What! a Spaniard, and laugh aloud! No, if
you laugh, thus only&mdash;so&mdash;Now your salutation in the
street, as you pass by your acquaintance; look you, thus&mdash;if
to a woman, thus&mdash;putting your hat upon your
heart; if to a man, thus, with a nod&mdash;so&mdash;but frown a
little more, frown:&mdash;but if to a woman you would be very
ceremonious to, thus&mdash;so&mdash;your neck nearer your
shoulder&mdash;so&mdash;Now, if you would speak contemptibly of any man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
or thing, do thus with your hand&mdash;so&mdash;and shrug up your
shoulders till they hide your ears.&mdash;[Monsieur <i>imitating
the</i> Black.] Now walk again.
[<i>The</i> Black <i>and</i> Monsieur <i>walk off the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> All my hopes are in that coxcomb there: I must
take up with my mistress's leavings, though we chambermaids
are wont to be beforehand with them. But he is
the dullest, modestest fool, for a frenchified fool, as ever I
saw; for nobody could be more coming to him than I
have been, though I say it, and yet I am ne'er the
nearer. I have stolen away his handkerchief, and told
him of it; and yet he would never so much as struggle
with me to get it again: I have pulled off his peruke,
untied his ribbons, and have been very bold with him:
yet he would never be so with me: nay, I have pinched
him, punched him and tickled him; and yet he would
never do the like for me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter the</i> Black <i>and</i> Monsieur.</p>

<p><i>Black.</i> Nay, thus, thus, sir.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> And to make my person more acceptable to
him, I have used art, as they say; for every night since
he came, I have worn the forehead-piece of bees-wax and
hog's-grease, and every morning washed with butter-milk
and wild tansy; and have put on every day for his only
sake my Sunday's bowdy<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> stockings, and have new-chalked
my shoes, as constantly as the morning came: nay,
I have taken occasion to garter my stockings before him,
as if unawares of him; for a good leg and foot, with good
shoes and stockings, are very provoking, as they say;
but the devil a bit would he be provoked.&mdash;But I must
think of a way. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Black.</i> Thus, thus.</p>

this time, little master; I will have no more, lest the
multiplicity of them make me forget them, da.&mdash;Prue, art
thou there and so pensive? what art thou thinking of?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Indeed, I am ashamed to tell your worship.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> What, ashamed! wert thou thinking then of my
beastliness? ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nay, then I am forced to tell your worship in my
own vindication.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Come then.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> But indeed, your worship&mdash;I'm ashamed, that I
am, though it was nothing but a dream I had of your
sweet worship last night.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Of my sweet worship! I warrant it was a sweet
dream then:&mdash;what was it? ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nay, indeed, I have told your worship enough
already; you may guess the rest.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I cannot guess; ha! ha! ha! What should it
be? prithee let's know the rest.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Would you have me so impudent?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Impudent! ha! ha! ha! Nay, prithee tell me;
for I can't guess, da&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nay, 'tis always so, for want of the men's guessing
the poor women are forced to be impudent:&mdash;but I
am still ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I will know it; speak.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Why then, methought last night you came up
into my chamber in your shirt when I was in bed; and
that you might easily do, for I have ne'er a lock to my
door.&mdash;Now I warrant I am as red as my petticoat.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, thou'rt as yellow as e'er thou wert.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Yellow, sir!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay: but let's hear the dream out.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Why, can't you guess the rest now?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, not I, I vow and swear: come, let's hear.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> But can't you guess, in earnest?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Not I, the devil eat me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Not guess yet! why then, methought you came
to bed to me.&mdash;Now am I as red as my petticoat again.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;well, and what then? ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Nay, now I know by your worship's laughing
you guess what you did. I'm sure I cried out, and
waked all in tears, with these words in my mouth&mdash;"You
have undone me! you have undone me! your worship
has undone me!"</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;but you waked, and found it
was but a dream.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Indeed it was so lively, I know not whether
'twas a dream, or no.&mdash;But if you were not there, I'll
undertake you may come when you will, and do anything
to me you will, I sleep so fast.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, no; I don't believe that.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Indeed you may, your worship&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> It cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Insensible beast! he will not understand me
yet; and one would think I speak plain enough. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, but, Prue, what art thou thinking of?</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Of the dream, whether it were a dream or no.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> 'Twas a dream, I warrant thee.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Was it? I am hugeous glad it was a dream.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, it was a dream: and I am hugeous glad
it was a dream too.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> But now I have told your worship my door has
neither lock nor latch to it, if you should be so naughty
as to come one night, and prove the dream true&mdash;I am so
afraid on't.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ne'er fear it:&mdash;dreams go by the contraries.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Then, by that I should come into your worship's
chamber, and come to bed to your worship.&mdash;Now am I
as red as my petticoat again, I warrant.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, thou art no redder than a brick unburnt,
Prue.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> But if I should do such a trick in my sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
your worship would not censure a poor harmless maid, I
hope?&mdash;for I am apt to walk in my sleep.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, then, Prue, because thou shalt not shame
thyself, poor wench, I'll be sure to lock my door every
night fast.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Nay, I am e'en well enough served for
not speaking my mind when I had an opportunity.&mdash;Well,

Your servant, your servant.</p>

at first&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I am afraid this fool should spoil all,
notwithstanding Hippolita's care and management; yet
I ought to trust her:&mdash;but a secret is more safe with a
treacherous knave than a talkative fool.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But, monsieur, what strange metamorphosis is
this? You look like a Spaniard, and talk like an
Englishman again, which I thought had been impossible.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nothing impossible to love: I must do't, or
lose my mistress, your pretty scholar; for 'tis I am to
have her. You may remember I told you she was
to be married to a great man, a man of honour and
quality.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But does she enjoin you to this severe penance?&mdash;such
I am sure it is to you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, no: 'tis by the compulsion of the starched
fop her father, who is so arrant a Spaniard, he would kill
you and his daughter, if he knew who you were: therefore
have a special care to dissemble well.
[<i>Draws him aside.</i></p>

dangerous a jest: therefore pray forgive me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I do, do heartily forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But can you forgive me for sending you at first,
like a fool as I was? 'Twas ill done of me: can you
forgive me?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, yes, I do forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, thou art a generous man, I vow and
swear, to come and take upon you all this trouble,
danger, and shame, to be thought a paltry dancing-master;
and all this to preserve a lady's honour and life,
who intended to abuse you. But I take the obligation
upon me.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Pish! pish! you are not obliged to me at all.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Faith, but I am strangely obliged to you.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith, but you are not.</p>

hold the door.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So, so:&mdash;to make him hold the door, while I
steal his mistress, is not unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay, but would you do so ill a thing, so treacherous
a thing? Faith 'tis not well.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith, I can't help it, since 'tis for your sake.&mdash;Come,
sweetest, is not this our way into the gallery?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes; but it goes against my conscience to be accessory
to so ill a thing.&mdash;You say you do it for my sake?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Alas, poor miss! 'tis not against your conscience,
but against your modesty, you think, to do it frankly.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, if it be against my modesty, too, I can't do
it indeed.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, come, miss, let us make haste:&mdash;all's ready.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, faith, I can't satisfy my scruple.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, dearest, this is not a time for scruples
nor modesty.&mdash;Modesty between lovers is as impertinent
as ceremony between friends; and modesty is now as
unseasonable as on the wedding night.&mdash;Come away, my
dearest.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Whither?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, sure we have lost too much time already.
Is that a proper question now? If you would know,
come along; for I have all ready.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I am not ready.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Truly, miss, we shall have your father come in
upon us, and prevent us again, as he did in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Twas well for me he did:&mdash;for, on my conscience,
if he had not come in, I had gone clear away with you
when I was in the humour.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, dearest, you would frighten me, as if you
were not yet in the same humour.&mdash;Come, come away;
the coach and six is ready.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis too late to take the air, and I am not ready.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> You were ready in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay, so I was.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come, come, miss:&mdash;indeed the jest begins to be
none.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What! I warrant you think me in jest then?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> In jest, certainly; but it begins to be troublesome.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But, sir, you could believe I was in earnest in the
morning, when I but seemed to be ready to go with you;
and why won't you believe me now when I declare to the
contrary?&mdash;I take it unkindly, that the longer I am
acquainted with you, you should have the less confidence
in me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> He'll hinder our design.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No, he will not; for mine is to stay here now.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Are you in earnest?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You'll find it so.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> How! why, you confessed but now you would
have gone with me in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I was in the humour then.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And I hope you are in the same still; you cannot
change so soon.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, is it not a whole day ago?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> What! are you not a day in the same humour?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Lord! that you who know the town, they say,
should think any woman could be a whole day together
in a humour!&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Hey! this begins to be pleasant.&mdash;What! won't
you go with me then after all?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No indeed, sir, I desire to be excused.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Then you have abused me all this while?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> It may be so.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Could all that so natural innocency be dissembled?&mdash;faith,
it could not, dearest miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Faith, it was, dear master.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Was it, faith?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Methinks you might believe me without an oath.
You saw I could dissemble with my father, why should
you think I could not with you?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So young a wheedle!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ay, a mere damned jade I am.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And I have been abused, you say?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis well you can believe it at last.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> And I must never hope for you?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Would you have me abuse you again?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Then you will not go with me?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No: but, for your comfort, your loss will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
great; and that you may not resent it, for once I'll be
ingenuous, and disabuse you.&mdash;I am no heiress, as I told
you, to twelve hundred pounds a-year; I was only a
lying jade then.&mdash;Now will you part with me willingly, I
doubt not.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I wish I could. [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Come, now I find 'tis your turn to dissemble:&mdash;but
men use to dissemble for money; will you dissemble
for nothing?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> 'Tis too late for me to dissemble.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Don't you dissemble, faith?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, this is too cruel.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What! would you take me without the twelve
hundred pounds a-year? would you be such a fool as to
steal a woman with nothing?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I'll convince you; for you shall go with me:&mdash;and
since you are twelve hundred pounds a-year the
lighter, you'll be the easier carried away.

<p><i>Hip.</i> O you have betrayed us all! If you confess that,
you undo us for ever. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I cannot play;&mdash;what would you have me say?
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I vow and swear we are all undone if you cannot
play. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! are you a dancing-master, and cannot
play? Umph&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> He is only out of humour, sir.&mdash;Here, master, I
know you will play for me yet;&mdash;for he has an excellent
hand. [<i>She offers</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>the violin.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, that he has.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] At giving a box on the ear.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Why does he not play, then?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Here, master, pray play for my sake.
[<i>Gives</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>the violin.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> What would you have me do with it?&mdash;I cannot
play a stroke. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> No! stay&mdash;then seem to tune it, and break the
strings. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Come then.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Next to the devil's, the
invention of women! They'll no more want an excuse to
cheat a father with, than an opportunity to abuse a husband.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
But what do you give me such a damned
fiddle with rotten strings, for?
[<i>Winds up the strings till they break, and throws
the violin on the ground.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Hey-day! the dancing-master is frantic.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! That people should be made
such fools of! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> He broke the strings on purpose, because
he could not play.&mdash;You are blind, brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! will you see further than I, look you?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But pray, master, why in such haste?
[<span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>offers to go.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Because you have done with me.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But don't you intend to come to-morrow, again?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Your daughter does not desire it.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No matter; I do; I must be your paymaster, I'm
sure. I would have you come betimes too; not only to
make her perfect, but since you have so good a hand upon
the violin, to play your part with half-a-dozen of musicians
more, whom I would have you bring with you: for we
will have a very merry wedding, though a very private
one.&mdash;You'll be sure to come?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Your daughter does not desire it.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, baggage, you shall desire it of him;
he is your master.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> My father will have me desire it of you, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But you'll make a fool of me again if I should
come; would you not?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> If I should tell you so, you'd be sure not to come.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, come, she shall not make a fool of you,
upon my word. I'll secure you, she shall do what you
will have her.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! So, so, silly Don. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But, madam, will you have me come?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I'd have you to know, for my part, I care not
whether you come or no:&mdash;there are other dancing-masters
to be had:&mdash;it is my father's request to you. All
that I have to say to you is a little good advice, which,
because I will not shame you, I'll give you in private.
[<i>Whispers</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> What! will you let her whisper with him
too?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Nay, if you find fault with it, they shall whisper,
though I did not like it before:&mdash;I'll ha' nobody wiser
than myself. But do you think, if 'twere any hurt, she
would whisper it to him before us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> If it be no hurt, why does she not speak
aloud?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Because she says she will not put the man out of
countenance.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Hey-day! put a dancing-master out of
countenance!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You say he is no dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Yes, for his impudence he may be a
dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, well, let her whisper before me as much as
she will to-night, since she is to be married to-morrow;&mdash;especially
since her husband (that shall be) stands by
consenting too.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, let 'em whisper, as you say, as much as
they will before we marry.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] She's making more
sport with him, I warrant.&mdash;But I wonder how people can
be fooled so.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, a penny for the secret, daughter.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, father, you shall have it for nothing to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Well, friend, you will not fail to come?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, no, sir.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Yet I am a fool if I do.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> And be sure you bring the fiddlers with you, as I
bid you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, be sure you bring the fiddlers with you, as I
bid you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> So, so: he'll fiddle your daughter out of the
house.&mdash;Must you have fiddles, with a fiddle faddle?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Lord! that people should be made such fools
of! Ha! ha! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Monsieur de <span class="smcap">Paris</span> <i>and the</i> Black, <i>stalking over
the stage; to them</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Good morrow to thee, noble
dancing-master:&mdash;ha! ha! ha! your
little black brother here, my master, I
see, is the more diligent man of the
two. But why do you come so late?&mdash;What!
you begin to neglect your
scholar, do you?&mdash;Little black master, <i>con licencia</i>, pray
get you out of the room.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Black.] What! out of
humour, man! a dancing-master should be like his fiddle,
always in tune. Come, my cousin has made an ass of
thee; what then? I know it.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Does he know it! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But prithee don't be angry: 'twas agreed upon
betwixt us, before I sent you, to make a fool of thee;&mdash;ha!
ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Was it so?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I knew you would be apt to entertain vain
hopes from the summons of a lady: but, faith, the
design was but to make a fool of thee, as you find.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> 'Tis very well.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But indeed I did not think the jest would have
lasted so long, and that my cousin would have made a
dancing-master of you, ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> The fool has reason, I find, and I am the coxcomb
while I thought him so. [<i>Aside</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Come, I see you are uneasy, and the jest of
being a dancing-master grows tedious to you:&mdash;but have
a little patience; the parson is sent for, and when once
my cousin and I are married, my uncle may know who
you are.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I am certainly abused. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> [<i>Listening.</i>] What do you say?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Merely fooled! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why do you doubt it? ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Can it be? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pish! pish! she told me yesterday as soon as
you were gone, that she had led you into a fool's paradise,
and made you believe she would go away with you&mdash;ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Did she so?&mdash;I am no longer to doubt it then.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, she makes a mere fool of thee, I vow
and swear; but don't be concerned, there's hardly a man
of a thousand but has been made a fool of by some
woman or other.&mdash;I have been made a fool of myself,
man, by the women; I have, I vow and swear I
have.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, you have, I believe it, for you are a coxcomb.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Lord! you need not be so touchy with one; I
tell you but the truth, for your good; for though she
does, I would not fool you any longer; but prithee don't
be troubled at what can't be helped. Women are made
on purpose to fool men: when they are children, they
fool their fathers; and when they have taken their leaves
of their hanging sleeves, they fool their gallants or
dancing masters,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Hark you, sir! to be fooled by a woman, you
say, is not to be helped; but I will not be fooled by a
fool.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> You show your English breeding now; an
English rival is so dull and brutish as not to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
raillery; but what is spoken in your passion I'll take no
notice of, for I am your friend, and would not have you
my rival to make yourself ridiculous.&mdash;Come, prithee,
prithee, don't be so concerned; for, as I was saying,
women first fool their fathers, then their gallants, and
then their husbands; so that it will be my turn to be
fooled too (for your comfort); and when they come to
be widows, they would fool the devil, I vow and swear.&mdash;Come,
come, dear Gerrard, prithee don't be out of
humour, and look so sillily.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Prithee do not talk so sillily.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, faith, I am resolved to beat you out of
this ill-humour.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith, I am afraid I shall first beat you into an
ill-humour.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! that thou shouldst be gulled so
by a little gipsy, who left off her bib but yesterday!&mdash;faith
I can't but laugh at thee.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith, then I shall make your mirth (as being
too violent) conclude in some little misfortune to you.
The fool begins to be tyrannical.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! poor angry dancing-master!
prithee match my Spanish pumps and legs with one of
your best and newest sarabands; ha! ha! ha! come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I will match your Spanish ear, thus, sir, and
make you dance thus. [<i>Strikes and kicks him.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How! sa! sa! sa! then I'll make you dance
thus.
[Monsieur <i>draws his sword and runs at him,
but</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span> <i>drawing, he retires.</i></p>

<p>Hold! hold a little!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] A desperate disappointed
lover will cut his own throat, then sure he will make
nothing of cutting his rival's throat.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Consideration is an enemy to fighting; if you
have a mind to revenge yourself, your sword's in your
hand.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pray, sir, hold your peace; I'll ne'er take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
rival's counsel, be't what 'twill. I know what you would
be at; you are disappointed of your mistress, and could
hang yourself, and therefore will not fear hanging. But
I am a successful lover, and need neither hang for you
nor my mistress: nay, if I should kill you, I know I
should do you a kindness; therefore e'en live, to die
daily with envy of my happiness. But if you will needs
die, kill yourself, and be damned for me, I vow and swear.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But won't you fight for your mistress?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I tell you, you shall not have the honour to be
killed for her: besides I will not be hit in the teeth by
her as long as I live, with the great love you had for her.
Women speak well of their dead husbands; what will
they do of their dead gallants?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But if you will not fight for her, you shall dance
for her, since you desired me to teach you to dance too;&mdash;I'll
teach you to dance thus&mdash;[<i>Strikes
his sword at his legs,</i> Monsieur <i>leaps.</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, if it be for the sake of my mistress, there's
nothing I will refuse to do.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Nay, you must dance on.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, for my mistress, and sing too, la, la, la,
ra, la.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What! swords drawn betwixt you two! what's
the matter?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Is she here?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come, put up
your sword; you see this is no place for us; but the
devil eat me if you shall not eat my sword, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What's the matter, cousin?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nothing, nothing, cousin, but your presence is
a sanctuary for my greatest enemy, or else, <i>tête non!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What, you have not hurt my cousin, sir, I hope?
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> How! she's concerned for him! nay, then I
need not doubt, my fears are true. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> What was that you said, cousin? hurt me!&mdash;ha!
ha! ha! hurt me!&mdash;if any man hurt me, he must
do it basely; he shall ne'er do it when my sword's
drawn, sa! sa! sa!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Because you will ne'er draw your sword, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Scurvily guessed.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] You ladies
may say anything; but, cousin, pray do not you talk of
swords and fighting; meddle with your guitar, and
talk of dancing with your dancing-master there, ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But I am afraid you have hurt my master,
cousin:&mdash;he says nothing; can he draw his breath?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, 'tis you have hurt your master, cousin, in
the very heart, cousin, and therefore he would hurt me;
for love is a disease makes people as malicious as the
plague does.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, poor master, something does ail you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, nay, cousin, faith don't abuse him any
longer; he's an honest gentleman, and has been long of
my acquaintance, and a man of tolerable sense, to take
him out of his love; but prithee, cousin, don't drive the
jest too far for my sake.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> He counsels you well, pleasant, cunning, jilting
miss, for his sake; for if I am your divertisement,
it shall be at his cost, since he's your gallant in favour.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I don't understand you.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But I do, a pox take him! and the custom
that so orders it, forsooth! that if a lady abuse or affront
a man, presently the gallant must be beaten; nay, what's
more unreasonable, if a woman abuse her husband, the
poor cuckold must bear the shame as well as the injury.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But what's the matter, master? what was it you
said?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I say, pleasant, cunning, jilting lady, though you
make him a cuckold, it will not be revenge enough for
me upon him for marrying you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> How! my surly, huffing, jealous, senseless, saucy
master?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, nay, faith, give losers leave to speak,
losers of mistresses especially, ha! ha! ha! Besides,
your anger is too great a favour for him; I scorn to
honour him with mine you see.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I tell you, my saucy master, my cousin shall
never be made that monstrous thing you mention, by
me.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Thank you, I vow and swear, cousin; no, no, I
never thought I should.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Sure you marry him by the sage maxim of your
sex, which is, wittols make the best husbands, that is,
cuckolds.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Indeed, master, whatsoever you think, I would
sooner choose you for that purpose than him.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ha! ha! ha! there she was with him, i'faith;&mdash;I
thank you for that, cousin, I vow and swear.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, he shall thank me for that too:&mdash;but how
came you two to quarrel? I thought, cousin, you had had
more wit than to quarrel, or more kindness for me than
to quarrel here. What if my father, hearing the bustle,
should have come in? he would have soon discovered
our false dancing-master (for passion unmasks every
man), and then the result of your quarrel had been my
ruin.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, you had both felt his desperate deadly
daunting dagger:&mdash;there are your d's for you!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Go, go presently, therefore, and hinder my father
from coming in, whilst I put my master into a better
humour, that we may not be discovered, to the prevention
of our wedding, or worse when he comes; go, go.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, well, I will, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Be sure you let him not come in this good
while.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, no, I warrant you.&mdash;[<i>Goes out and returns.</i>]&mdash;But
if he should come before I would have him, I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
come before him, and cough and hawk soundly, that you
may not be surprised. Won't that do well, cousin?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Very well, pray begone.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Monsieur.]
Well, master, since I find you are quarrelsome and
melancholy, and would have taken me away without a
portion, three infallible signs of a true lover, faith here's
my hand now in earnest, to lead me a dance as long as I
live.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> How's this! you surprise me as much, as when
first I found so much beauty and wit in company with so
much innocency. But, dearest, I would be assured of
what you say, and yet dare not ask the question. You
h&mdash;&mdash;do not abuse me again? You h&mdash;&mdash;will fool me
no more sure?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Yes, but I will sure.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> How? nay, I was afraid on't.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> For, I say, you are to be my husband, and you
say husbands must be wittols, and some strange things to
boot.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Well, I will take my fortune.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> But have a care, rash man.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I will venture.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> At your peril; remember I wished you to have a
care: forewarned, fore-armed.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Indeed now, that's fair; for most men are fore-armed
before they are warned.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Plain dealing is some kind of honesty however,
and few women would have said so much.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> None but those who would delight in a husband's
jealousy, as the proof of his love and her honour.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Hold, sir, let us have a good understanding
betwixt one another at first, that we may be long friends.
I differ from you in the point; for a husband's jealousy,
which cunning men would pass upon their wives for a
compliment, is the worst can be made 'em; for indeed it
is a compliment to their beauty, but an affront to their
honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So that upon the whole matter I conclude,
jealousy in a gallant is humble true love, and the height
of respect, and only an undervaluing of himself to overvalue
her; but in a husband 'tis arrant sauciness,
cowardice, and ill-breeding, and not to be suffered.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> I stand corrected, gracious miss.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, but have you brought the gentlemen
fiddlers with you, as I desired?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> They are below.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Are they armed well?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Yes, they have instruments too that are not of
wood; but what will you do with them?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> What did you think I intended to do with
them? when I whispered you to bring gentlemen of your
acquaintance instead of fiddlers, as my father desired you
to bring, pray what did you think I intended?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Faith, e'en to make fools of the gentlemen
fiddlers, as you had done of your gentleman dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I intended 'em for our guard and defence against
my father's Spanish and Guinea force, when we were to
make our retreat from hence; and to help us to take the
keys from my aunt, who has been the watchful porter
of this house this twelve-month; and this design (if your
heart do not fail you) we will put in execution as soon as
you have given your friends below instructions.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Are you sure your heart will stand right still?
You flinched last night, when I little expected it, I am
sure.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> The time last night was not so proper for us as
now, for reasons I will give you. But besides that, I
confess I had a mind to try whether your interest did
not sway you more than your love; whether the twelve
hundred pounds a-year I told you of had not made a
greater impression in your heart than Hippolita: but
finding it otherwise&mdash;yet hold, perhaps upon consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
you are grown wiser; can you yet, as I said, be so
desperate, so out of fashion, as to steal a woman with
nothing?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> With you I can want nothing, nor can be made
by anything more rich or happy.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Think well again; can you take me without the
twelve hundred pounds a-year,&mdash;the twelve hundred
pounds a-year?</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Indeed, miss, now you begin to be unkind again,
and use me worse than e'er you did.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Well, though you are so modest a gentleman as
to suffer a wife to be put upon you with nothing, I have
more conscience than to do it. I have the twelve
hundred pounds a-year out of my father's power, which
is yours, and I am sorry it is not the Indies to mend
your bargain.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> Dear miss, you but increase my fears, and not
my wealth. Pray let us make haste away; I desire but
to be secure of you:&mdash;come, what are you thinking
of?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I am thinking if some little, filching, inquisitive
poet should get my story, and represent it to the stage,
what those ladies who are never precise but at a play
would say of me now;&mdash;that I were a confident, coming
piece, I warrant, and they would damn the poor poet for
libelling the sex. But sure, though I give myself and
fortune away frankly, without the consent of my friends,
my confidence is less than theirs who stand off only for
separate maintenance.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> They would be widows before their time, have a

should recant my happiness, now you are fixed, my

means that, friend, ha?&mdash;Daughter, ha! do you permit
this insolence, ha? <i>voto á mi honra!</i></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> We are prevented again. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Ha! ha! ha! you are so full of your Spanish
jealousy, father; why, you must know he is a city
dancing-master, and they, forsooth, think it fine to kiss
the hand at the honour before the corant.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Ay, ay, ay, uncle, don't you know that?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Go to, go to, you are an easy French fool;
there's more in it than so, look you.</p>

you'll believe one.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolita</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard</span>.]
Did not I cough and hawk? a jealous, prudent husband
could not cough and hawk louder at the approach of his
wife's chamber in visiting time, and yet you would not
hear me. He'll make now ado about nothing, and you'll
be discovered both.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Umph, umph,&mdash;no, no, I see it plain, he is no
dancing-master: now I have found it out, and I think I
can see as far into matters as another: I have found it
now, look you.</p>

matter?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I have found it out, sister, I have found it out,
sister; this villain here is no dancing-master&mdash;but a dishonourer
of my house and daughter; I caught him
kissing her hand.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pish! pish! you are a strange Spanish kind of
an uncle, that you are.&mdash;A dishonourer of your daughter,
because he kissed her hand! pray how could he honour
her more? he kissed her hand, you see, while he was
making his honour to her.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You are an unthinking, shallow French fop,

have found it out; he is no dancing-master, sister. Do
you remember the whispering last night? I have found
out the meaning of that too; and I tell you, sister, he's
no dancing-master, I have found it out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> You found it out! marry come up, did
not I tell you always he was no dancing-master?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> You tell me! you silly woman, what then? what
of that?&mdash;You tell me! d'ye think I heeded what you
told me? but I tell you now I have found it out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I say I found it out.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I say 'tis false, gossip, I found him out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I say I found him out first, say you what
you will.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Sister, mum, not such a word again, <i>guarda!</i>&mdash;You
found him out!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I must submit, or dissemble like other

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> O yes, he is a dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> What! will you be wiser than I every way?&mdash;remember
the whispering, I say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, he thinks I speak in earnest,
then I'll fit him still.&mdash;[<i>To</i> Don <span class="smcap">Diego</span>.] But what do
you talk of their whispering! they would not whisper any
ill before us, sure.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Will you still be an idiot, a dolt, and see
nothing?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Lord! you'll be wiser than all the world, will
you? are we not all against you? pshaw! pshaw! I ne'er
saw such a <i>donissimo</i> as you are, I vow and swear.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, sister, he's no dancing-master; for now I

upon a fiddle without strings?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Again, I tell you he broke them on purpose, because
he could not play; I have found it out now, sister.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Besides, if you remember, they were perpetually
putting me out of the room; that was, sister, because
they had a mind to be alone, I have found that out too:&mdash;now,
sister, look you, he is no dancing-master.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> But has he not given her a lesson often
before you?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Ay, but sister, he did not go about his business
like a dancing-master; but go, go down to the door,
somebody rings. [<i>Exit</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Caution</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I vow and swear, uncle, he is a dancing-master;

you a lie?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> If it prove to be a lie, and you do not confess it,
though you are my next heir after my daughter, I will
disown thee as much as I do her, for thy folly and
treachery to thyself, as well as me.&mdash;You may have her,

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, pray, uncle, hear me.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I say, we are descended&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> 'Tis no matter for that.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> And my great, great, great-grandfather was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, well, I have something to say more to
the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> My great, great, great-grandfather, I say, was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, a pinmaker in&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But he was a gentleman for all that, fop, for he
was a sergeant to a company of the trainbands; and my

<p><i>Mons.</i> Was his son, what then? won't you let me clear
this gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> He was, he was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> He was a felt-maker, his son a wine-cooper,
your father a vintner, and so you came to be a Canary
merchant.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> But we were still gentlemen, for our coat was, as
the heralds say&mdash;was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Was! your sign was the Three Tuns, and the

<p><i>Mons.</i> Hold, hold, uncle, are you mad?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Oh! oh!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay then, by your own Spanish rules of honour
(though he be my rival), I must help him; [<i>Draws his
sword.</i>] since I brought him into danger.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Sure
he will not show his valour upon his nephew and son-in-law,
otherwise I should be afraid of showing mine.&mdash;Here,
Mr. Gerrard, go in here, nay, you shall go in, Mr.
Gerrard, I'll secure you all; and, parson, do you go in
too with 'em, for I see you are afraid of a sword and the
other world, though you talk of it so familiarly, and make
it so fine a place.
[<i>Opens a door, and thrusts</i> <span class="smcap">Gerrard, Hippolita</span>,

<p><i>Don. Tu quoque, Brute!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nay, now, uncle, you must understand reason.&mdash;What,
you are not only a Don, but you are a Don
Quixote too, I vow and swear!</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Thou spot, sploach<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> of my family and blood! I

<p><i>Mons.</i> Pray, good Spanish uncle, have but patience to
hear me. Suppose&mdash;I say, suppose he had done, done,
done the feat to your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How! done the feat! done the feat: done the
feat! <i>en hora mala!</i></p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I say, suppose, suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Suppose!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> I say, suppose he had, for I do but suppose it;
well, I am ready to marry her, however. Now marriage
is as good a solder for cracked female honour as blood;
and can't you suffer the shame but for a quarter of an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
till the parson has married us? and then if there be any
shame, it becomes mine; for here in England, the father
has nothing to do with the daughter's business, honour,
what d'ye call't, when once she's married, d'ye see.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> England! what d'ye tell me of England? I'll be

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> They are relations, they say, of my cousin's,
who pressed in when I let in the parson; they say my
cousin invited 'em to his wedding.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Two of my relations!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Ha! they are
my cousins indeed of the other night; a pox take 'em!&mdash;but
that's no curse for 'em; a plague take 'em then!&mdash;but
how came they here?</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now must I have witnesses too of the

Pray, ladies, say as I say, or you will spoil my wedding,
for I am just going to be married; and if my uncle or

If they come to the wedding, ladies, I assure you there

[<i>Aside to them.</i></p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> We care not, 'tis our business to spoil matches.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> You need not, for I believe married men are
your best customers, for greedy bachelors take up with
their wives.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Come, pray ladies, if you have no business here,
be pleased to retire; for few of us are in humour to be
so civil to you as you may deserve.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> We are no persons of honour and quality, sir,
we are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> They are modest ladies, and being in a kind of
disguise, will not own their quality.</p>

<p><i>Flou.</i> We modest ladies!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why, sometimes you are in the humour to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
for women of honour and quality; prithee, dear jades,

<p><i>Hip.</i> Nay, indeed, father, now we are married, you
had better call the fiddlers.&mdash;Call 'em, Prue, quickly.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Who do you say, married, man?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Was I not sent for on purpose to marry 'em?
why should you wonder at it?</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> No, no, you were to marry me, man, to her; I
knew there was a mistake in't somehow; you were merely
mistaken, therefore you must do your business over again
for me now.&mdash;The parson was mistaken, uncle, it seems,
ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> I suppose five or six guineas made him
make the mistake, which will not be rectified now,

a guinea or two, care not what mischief they do, nephew.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Married!&mdash;Pedro! Sanchez!</p>

of honour in revenge. Come, uncle, I'm of your side

<p><i>Mar.</i> We fiddlers, sir, often come unsent for.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> No, sir, our company was never kicked, I think.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, Flirt, now I am a match for thee: now I
may keep you.&mdash;And there's little difference betwixt
keeping a wench and marriage; only marriage is a little
the cheaper; but the other is the more honourable now,

too. Come, come, I am thine; let us strike up the bargain:
thine, according to the honourable institution of
keeping.&mdash;Come.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Nay, hold, sir; two words to the bargain; first,
I have ne'er a lawyer here to draw articles and settlements.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How! is the world come to that? A man cannot
keep a wench without articles and settlements! Nay,
then 'tis e'en as bad as marriage, indeed, and there's no
difference betwixt a wife and a wench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Only in cohabitation; for the first article shall
be against cohabitation:&mdash;we mistresses suffer no cohabitation.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Nor wives neither now.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then separate maintenance, in case you should
take a wife, or I a new friend.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How! that too! then you are every whit as bad
as a wife.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then my house in town and yours in the
country, if you will.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> A mere wife!</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then my coach apart, as well as my bed apart.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> As bad as a wife still!</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> But take notice, I will have no little, dirty,
second-hand chariot new furbished, but a large, sociable,
well-painted coach; nor will I keep it till it be as well
known as myself, and it come to be called Flirt-coach;
nor will I have such pitiful horses as cannot carry me
every night to the Park; for I will not miss a night in the
Park, I'd have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> 'Tis very well: you must have your great, gilt,
fine painted coaches. I'm sure they are grown so
common already amongst you, that ladies of quality
begin to take up with hackneys again, <i>jarni!</i>&mdash;But what
else?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then, that you do not think I will be served by
a little dirty boy in a bonnet, but a couple of handsome,
lusty, cleanly footmen, fit to serve ladies of quality, and
do their business as they should do.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> What then?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then, that you never grow jealous of them.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Why, will you make so much of them?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> I delight to be kind to my servants.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Well, is this all?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> No.&mdash;Then, that when you come to my house,
you never presume to touch a key, lift up a latch, or
thrust a door, without knocking beforehand: and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
you ask no questions, if you see a stray piece of plate,
cabinet, or looking-glass, in my house.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Just a wife in everything.&mdash;But what else?</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then, that you take no acquaintance with me
abroad, nor bring me home any when you are drunk,
whom you will not be willing to see there when you are
sober.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> But what allowance? let's come to the main
business; the money.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Stay, let me think: first for advance-money, five
hundred pounds for pins.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> A very wife!</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then you must take the lease of my house, and
furnish it as becomes one of my quality; for don't you
think we'll take up with your old Queen Elizabeth
furniture, as your wives do.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Indeed there she is least like a wife, as she
says.</p>

<p><i>Flirt.</i> Then for house-keeping, servants' wages, clothes,
and the rest, I'll be contented with a thousand pounds a
year present maintenance, and but three hundred pounds
a year separate maintenance for my life, when your love
grows cold. But I am contented with a thousand pounds
a year, because for pendants, neck-laces, and all sorts of
jewels, and such trifles, nay, and some plate, I will shift
myself as I can; make shifts, which you shall not take
any notice of.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> A thousand pounds a year! what will wenching
come to? Time was a man might have fared as well at
a much cheaper rate, and a lady of one's affections, instead
of a house, would have been contented with a little
chamber, three pair of stairs backward, with a little closet
or ladder to't; and instead of variety of new gowns and
rich petticoats, with her <i>deshabillé</i>, or flame-colour gown
called Indian, and slippers of the same, would have been
contented for a twelvemonth; and instead of visits and
gadding to plays, would have entertained herself at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
with "St. George for England," "The Knight of the
Sun," or "The Practice of Piety;" and instead of sending
her wine and meat from the French-houses, would
have been contented, if you had given her, poor wretch,
but credit at the next chandler's and chequered cellar;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and then, instead of a coach, would have been well satisfied
to have gone out and taken the air for three or four
hours in the evening in the balcony, poor soul. Well,
Flirt, however, we'll agree:&mdash;'tis but three hundred
pounds a year separate maintenance, you say, when I am
weary of thee and the charge.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Robbed of my honour, my daughter,
and my revenge too! O my dear honour! Nothing
vexes me, but that the world should say I had not
Spanish policy enough to keep my daughter from being
debauched from me. But methinks my Spanish policy
might help me yet. I have it&mdash;so&mdash;I will cheat 'em all;
for I will declare I understood the whole plot and contrivance,
and connived at it, finding my cousin a fool, and
not answering my expectation. Well, but then if I
approve of the match, I must give this mock-dancing-master
my estate, especially since half he would have in
right of my daughter, and in spite of me. Well, I am resolved
to turn the cheat upon themselves, and give them
my consent and estate.</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> Come, come, ne'er be troubled, uncle: 'twas a
combination, you see, of all these heads and your
daughter's, you know what I mean, uncle, not to be
thwarted or governed by all the Spanish policy in Christendom.
I'm sure my French policy would not have
governed her; so since I have 'scaped her, I am glad I
have 'scaped her, <i>jarni!</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Come, brother, you are wiser than I, you
see: ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> No, you think you are wiser than I now, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
earnest: but know, while I was thought a gull, I gulled
you all, and made them and you think I knew nothing of
the contrivance. Confess, did not you think verily that
I knew nothing of it, and that I was a gull?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Yes indeed, brother, I did think verily you
were a gull.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> How's this? [<i>Listening.</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> Alas, alas! all the sputter I made was but to
make this young man, my cousin, believe, when the thing
should be effected, that it was not with my connivance or
consent; but since he is so well satisfied, I own it. For
do you think I would ever have suffered her to marry a
monsieur, a monsieur? <i>guarda!</i>&mdash;besides, it had been
but a beastly incestuous kind of a match, <i>voto!</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, then I see, brother, you are wiser than
I indeed.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> So, so.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caut.</i> Nay, young man, you have danced a fair
dance for yourself, royally; and now you may go jig it
together till you are both weary. And though you were
so eager to have him, Mrs. Minx, you'll soon have your
bellyful of him, let me tell you, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> Ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mons.</i> How, uncle! what was't you said? Nay, if I
had your Spanish policy against me, it was no wonder I
missed of my aim, <i>ma foi!</i></p>

<p><i>Don.</i> I was resolved too my daughter should not marry
a coward, therefore made the more the more ado to try
you, sir. But I find you are a brisk man of honour, firm
stiff Spanish honour; and that you may see I deceived
you all along, and you not me, ay, and am able to deceive
you still, for I know now you think that I will give you
little or nothing with my daughter, like other fathers,
since you have married her without my consent&mdash;but, I
say, I'll deceive you now; for you shall have the most
part of my estate in present, and the rest at my death.&mdash;There's
for you: I think I have deceived you now, look you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> No, indeed, sir, you have not deceived me; for
I never suspected your love to your daughter, nor your
generosity.</p>

<p><i>Don.</i> How, sir! have a care of saying I have not deceived
you, lest I deceive you another way, <i>guarda!</i>&mdash;Pray,
gentlemen, do not think any man could deceive me,
look you; that any man could steal my daughter, look
you, without my connivance:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The less we speak, the more we think;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he sees most, that seems to wink.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> So, so, now I could give you my blessing, father;
now you are a good complaisant father, indeed:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When children marry, parents should obey,</span><br />

<p><i>The Country Wife</i> was written,
according to its author's own statement,
about the year 1671 or 1672. Its production
upon the stage was subsequent to
that of <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>,
to which allusion is made in the prologue,
and antecedent to that of the earlier-written
<i>Plain Dealer</i>, in the second act of which the author
inserted some critical observations upon <i>The Country Wife</i>.
The first performance of <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, as will afterwards
appear, admits not of a later date than that of March, or the
very beginning of April, 1674; it follows then that <i>The
Country Wife</i> was brought forward some time between the
early spring of 1672 and that of 1674. It was acted by the
King's Company, established during these two years at the
theatre in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was
published in the year 1675.</p>

<p>If we can overlook the immorality which, in this play, is
more offensive and pronounced than in any of Wycherley's
other dramas, we shall find in <i>The Country Wife</i> a brilliantly
written and skilfully constructed comedy, superior to either
of the preceding dramas from the same pen, and surpassed,
among comedies of the Restoration, only by its author's own
masterpiece, <i>The Plain Dealer</i>. The plot of <i>The Country
Wife</i> is partly based upon two comedies by Molière&mdash;<i>L'Ecole
des Femmes</i> and <i>L'Ecole des Maris</i>. From the former of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
these Wycherley derived his conception of the jealous man
who keeps under close restraint a young and ignorant woman,
with the vain hope of thereby securing her fidelity to him.
Agnes's innocent confessions to Arnolphe of her lover's
stratagems and her own esteem for him find a counterpart in
the Country Wife's frankness on a similar occasion, but
beyond these points of coincidence there is little resemblance
between the two plays. From <i>L'Ecole des Maris</i>, again,
Wycherley has borrowed one or two incidents: the imprisoned
girl's device of making her would-be husband (in
the English play, her actual husband) the bearer of a letter
to her gallant, and the trick by which Isabella causes her
tyrant, under the impression that she is another woman, to
consign her with his own hands to his rival.</p>

<p>Steele has published, in the <i>Tatler</i> of April 16, 1709, a
very just criticism upon this play, which, as it cannot fail to
interest the reader, I venture to subjoin.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Will's Coffee-house, April 14.</p>

<p>"This evening the Comedy, called <i>The Country Wife</i>, was
acted in Drury Lane, for the benefit of Mrs. Bignell. The
part which gives name to the Play was performed by herself.
Through the whole action she made a very pretty figure, and
exactly entered into the nature of the part. Her husband,
in the Drama, is represented to be one of those debauchees
who run through the vices of the town, and believe, when
they think fit, they can marry and settle at their ease. His
own knowledge of the iniquity of the age makes him choose
a wife wholly ignorant of it, and place his security in her
want of skill to abuse him. The Poet, on many occasions,
where the propriety of the character will admit of it, insinuates
that there is no defence against vice but the contempt of
it: and has, in the natural ideas of an untainted innocent,
shown the gradual steps to ruin and destruction which persons
of condition run into, without the help of a good education
to form their conduct. The torment of a jealous coxcomb,
which arises from his own false maxims, and the
aggravation of his pain by the very words in which he sees
her innocence, makes a very pleasant and instructive satire.
The character of Horner, and the design of it, is a good
representation of the age in which that Comedy was written:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
at which time love and wenching were the business of life,
and the gallant manner of pursuing women was the best
recommendation at Court. To this only it is to be imputed
that a Gentleman of Mr. Wycherley's character and sense
condescends to represent the insults done to the honour of
the bed without just reproof; but to have drawn a man of
probity with regard to such considerations had been a
monster, and a Poet had at that time discovered his want of
knowing the manners of the Court he lived in, by a virtuous
character in his fine gentleman, as he would show his
ignorance by drawing a vicious one to please the present
audience."</p></blockquote>

<h2><i>THE COUNTRY WIFE.</i></h2>

<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horner's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>, <i>and</i> Quack <i>following him at a distance.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A quack is as fit for a
pimp, as a midwife for a bawd; they
are still but in their way, both helpers
of nature.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Well, my dear
doctor, hast thou done what I desired?</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> I have undone you for ever
with the women, and reported you throughout the whole
town as bad as an eunuch, with as much trouble as if
I had made you one in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But have you told all the midwives you know,
the orange wenches at the playhouses, the city husbands,
and old fumbling keepers of this end of the town? for
they'll be the readiest to report it.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> I have told all the chambermaids, waiting-women,
tire-women, and old women of my acquaintance;
nay, and whispered it as a secret to 'em, and to the
whisperers of Whitehall; so that you need not doubt
'twill spread, and you will be as odious to the handsome
young women, as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> As the small-pox. Well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> And to the married women of this end of the
town, as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> As the great one; nay, as their own husbands.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> And to the city dames, as aniseed Robin, of
filthy and contemptible memory; and they will frighten
their children with your name, especially their females.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And cry, Horner's coming to carry you away.
I am only afraid 'twill not be believed. You told 'em it
was by an English-French disaster, and an English-French
chirurgeon, who has given me at once not only a cure,
but an antidote for the future against that damned
malady, and that worse distemper, love, and all other
women's evils?</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Your late journey into France has made it the
more credible, and your being here a fortnight before you
appeared in public, looks as if you apprehended the
shame, which I wonder you do not. Well, I have been
hired by young gallants to belie 'em t'other way; but you
are the first would be thought a man unfit for women.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Dear Mr. Doctor, let vain rogues be contented
only to be thought abler men than they are, generally 'tis
all the pleasure they have; but mine lies another way.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> You take, methinks, a very preposterous way
to it, and as ridiculous as if we operators in physic
should put forth bills to disparage our medicaments, with
hopes to gain customers.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Doctor, there are quacks in love as well as
physic, who get but the fewer and worse patients for
their boasting; a good name is seldom got by giving it
one's self; and women, no more than honour, are compassed
by bragging. Come, come, Doctor, the wisest
lawyer never discovers the merits of his cause till the
trial; the wealthiest man conceals his riches, and the
cunning gamester his play. Shy husbands and keepers,
like old rooks, are not to be cheated but by a new unpractised
trick: false friendship will pass now no more than
false dice upon 'em; no, not in the city.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> There are two ladies and a gentleman coming up.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox! some unbelieving sisters of my former
acquaintance, who, I am afraid, expect their sense should
be satisfied of the falsity of the report. No&mdash;this formal
fool and women!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, <i>and</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Dainty Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> His wife and sister.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> My coach breaking just now before your
door, sir, I look upon as an occasional reprimand to
me, sir, for not kissing your hands, sir, since your coming
out of France, sir; and so my disaster, sir, has been my
good fortune, sir; and this is my wife and sister, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What then, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> My lady, and sister, sir.&mdash;Wife, this is Master
Horner.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Master Horner, husband!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> My lady, my Lady Fidget, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Won't you be acquainted with her, sir?&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
So, the report is true, I find, by his coldness or
aversion to the sex; but I'll play the wag with him.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Pray salute my wife, my lady, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I will kiss no man's wife, sir, for him, sir; I
have taken my eternal leave, sir, of the sex already, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ha! ha! ha! I'll plague him yet.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Not know my wife, sir?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I do know your wife, sir; she's a woman, sir,
and consequently a monster, sir, a greater monster than
a husband, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> A husband! how, sir?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, sir; but I make no more cuckolds, sir.

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Mercury! Mercury!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Pray, Sir Jasper, let us be gone from this
rude fellow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Who, by his breeding, would think he had
ever been in France?</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Foh! he's but too much a French fellow,
such as hate women of quality and virtue for their love to
their husbands. Sir Jasper, a woman is hated by 'em as
much for loving her husband as for loving their money.
But pray let's be gone.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> You do well, madam; for I have nothing that
you came for. I have brought over not so much as a
bawdy picture, no new postures, nor the second part of
the <i>Ecole des Filles</i>; nor&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Hold, for shame, sir! what d'ye mean? you'll
ruin yourself for ever with the sex&mdash;[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha! ha! ha! he hates women perfectly, I
find.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> What pity 'tis he should!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Ay, he's a base fellow for't. But affectation
makes not a woman more odious to them than virtue.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Because your virtue is your greatest affectation,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> How, you saucy fellow! would you wrong
my honour?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> If I could.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> How d'ye mean, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha! ha! ha! no, he can't wrong your ladyship's
honour, upon my honour. He, poor man&mdash;hark
you in your ear&mdash;a mere eunuch. [<i>Whispers.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> O filthy French beast! foh! foh! why do
we stay? let's be gone: I can't endure the sight of him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Stay but till the chairs come; they'll be here
presently.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> No, no.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Nor can I stay longer. 'Tis, let me see, a
quarter and half quarter of a minute past eleven. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>

preferred always before love and ceremony with the wise,
Mr. Horner.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And the impotent, Sir Jasper.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ay, ay, the impotent, Master Horner; hah!
hah! hah!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> What, leave us with a filthy man alone in his
lodgings?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He's an innocent man now, you know. Pray
stay, I'll hasten the chairs to you.&mdash;Mr. Horner, your
servant; I should be glad to see you at my house. Pray
come and dine with me, and play at cards with my wife
after dinner; you are fit for women at that game yet, ha!
ha!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] 'Tis as much a husband's prudence to
provide innocent diversion for a wife as to hinder her
unlawful pleasures; and he had better employ her than
let her employ herself.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Farewell.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Your servant, Sir Jasper. [<i>Exit</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> I will not stay with him, foh!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, madam, I beseech you stay, if it be but to
see I can be as civil to ladies yet as they would desire.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> No, no, foh! you cannot be civil to ladies.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> You as civil as ladies would desire?</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Now, I think, I, or you yourself, rather, have
done your business with the women.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Thou art an ass. Don't you see already, upon
the report, and my carriage, this grave man of business
leaves his wife in my lodgings, invites me to his house
and wife, who before would not be acquainted with me
out of jealousy?</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Nay, by this means you may be the more
acquainted with the husbands, but the less with the
wives.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Let me alone; if I can but abuse the husbands,
I'll soon disabuse the wives. Stay&mdash;I'll reckon you up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the advantages I am like to have by my stratagem.
First, I shall be rid of all my old acquaintances, the most
insatiable sort of duns, that invade our lodgings in a
morning; and next to the pleasure of making a new
mistress is that of being rid of an old one, and of all old
debts. Love, when it comes to be so, is paid the most
unwillingly.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Well, you may be so rid of your old acquaintances;
but how will you get any new ones?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Doctor, thou wilt never make a good chemist,
thou art so incredulous and impatient. Ask but all the
young fellows of the town if they do not lose more time,
like huntsmen, in starting the game, than in running it
down. One knows not where to find 'em; who will or
will not. Women of quality are so civil, you can hardly
distinguish love from good breeding, and a man is often
mistaken: but now I can be sure she that shows an
aversion to me loves the sport, as those women that are
gone, whom I warrant to be right. And then the next
thing is, your women of honour, as you call 'em, are only
chary of their reputations, not their persons; and 'tis
scandal they would avoid, not men. Now may I have,
by the reputation of an eunuch, the privileges of one, and
be seen in a lady's chamber in a morning as early as her
husband; kiss virgins before their parents or lovers; and
may be, in short, the <i>passe-partout</i> of the town. Now,
doctor.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Nay, now you shall be the doctor; and your
process is so new that we do not know but it may
succeed.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Not so new neither; <i>probatum est</i>, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Well, I wish you luck, and many patients,
whilst I go to mine. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Come, your appearance at the play yesterday, has,
I hope, hardened you for the future against the women's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
contempt, and the men's raillery; and now you'll abroad
as you were wont.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Did I not bear it bravely?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> With a most theatrical impudence, nay, more
than the orange-wenches show there, or a drunken vizard-mask,
or a great-bellied actress; nay, or the most impudent
of creatures, an ill poet; or what is yet more
impudent, a second-hand critic.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But what say the ladies? have they no pity?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> What ladies? The vizard-masks, you know,
never pity a man when all's gone, though in their service.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And for the women in the boxes, you'd never pity
them when 'twas in your power.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> They say 'tis pity but all that deal with common
women should be served so.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, I dare swear they won't admit you to play
at cards with them, go to plays with 'em, or do the little
duties which other shadows of men are wont to do for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What do you call shadows of men?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Half-men.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What, boys?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, your old boys, old <i>beaux garçons</i>, who, like
superannuated stallions, are suffered to run, feed, and
whinny with the mares as long as they live, though they
can do nothing else.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, a pox on love and wenching! Women
serve but to keep a man from better company. Though
I can't enjoy them, I shall you the more. Good fellowship
and friendship are lasting, rational, and manly
pleasures.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> For all that, give me some of those pleasures you
call effeminate too; they help to relish one another.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> They disturb one another.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, mistresses are like books. If you pore upon
them too much, they doze you, and make you unfit for
company; but if used discreetly, you are the fitter for conversation
by 'em.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> A mistress should be like a little country retreat
near the town; not to dwell in constantly, but only for a
night and away, to taste the town the better when a man
returns.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I tell you, 'tis as hard to be a good fellow, a
good friend, and a lover of women, as 'tis to be a good
fellow, a good friend, and a lover of money. You cannot
follow both, then choose your side. Wine gives you
liberty, love takes it away.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Gad, he's in the right on't.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Wine gives you joy; love, grief and tortures,
besides surgeons. Wine makes us witty; love, only sots.
Wine makes us sleep; love breaks it.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> By the world he has reason, Harcourt.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Wine makes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, wine makes us&mdash;makes us princes; love
makes us beggars, poor rogues, egad&mdash;and wine&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, there's one converted.&mdash;No, no, love and
wine, oil and vinegar.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I grant it; love will still be uppermost.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come, for my part, I will have only those
glorious manly pleasures of being very drunk and very
slovenly.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Boy.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Mr. Sparkish is below, sir. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> What, my dear friend! a rogue that is fond of me
only, I think, for abusing him.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, he can no more think the men laugh at him
than that women jilt him; his opinion of himself is so
good.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, there's another pleasure by drinking I
thought not of,&mdash;I shall lose his acquaintance, because
he cannot drink: and you know 'tis a very hard thing to
be rid of him; for he's one of those nauseous offerers at
wit, who, like the worst fiddlers, run themselves into all
companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> One that, by being in the company of men of
sense, would pass for one.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And may so to the short-sighted world; as a
false jewel amongst true ones is not discerned at a distance.
His company is as troublesome to us as a cuckold's when
you have a mind to his wife's.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, the rogue will not let us enjoy one another,
but ravishes our conversation; though he signifies no
more to't than Sir Martin Mar-all's<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> gaping, and awkward
thrumming upon the lute, does to his man's voice and
music.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And to pass for a wit in town shows himself a
fool every night to us, that are guilty of the plot.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Such wits as he are, to a company of reasonable
men, like rooks to the gamesters; who only fill a room
at the table, but are so far from contributing to the play,
that they only serve to spoil the fancy of those that do.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, they are used like rooks too, snubbed,
checked, and abused; yet the rogues will hang on.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox on 'em, and all that force nature, and
would be still what she forbids 'em! Affectation is her
greatest monster.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Most men are the contraries to that they would
seem. Your bully, you see, is a coward with a long
sword; the little humbly-fawning physician, with his
ebony cane, is he that destroys men.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> The usurer, a poor rogue, possessed of mouldy
bonds and mortgages; and we they call spendthrifts,
are only wealthy, who lay out his money upon daily new
purchases of pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, your arrantest cheat is your trustee or
executor; your jealous man, the greatest cuckold; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
churchman the greatest atheist; and your noisy pert
rogue of a wit, the greatest fop, dullest ass, and worst
company, as you shall see; for here he comes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How is't, sparks? how is't? Well, faith,
Harry, I must rally thee a little, ha! ha! ha! upon the
report in town of thee, ha! ha! ha! I can't hold i'faith;
shall I speak?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes; but you'll be so bitter then.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Honest Dick and Frank here shall answer for
me; I will not be extreme bitter, by the universe.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> We will be bound in a ten thousand pound bond,
he shall not be bitter at all.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nor sharp, nor sweet.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What, not downright insipid?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay then, since you are so brisk, and provoke
me, take what follows. You must know, I was discoursing
and rallying with some ladies yesterday, and they happened
to talk of the fine new signs in town&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Very fine ladies, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Said I, I know where the best new sign is.&mdash;Where?
says one of the ladies.&mdash;In Covent-Garden, I
replied.&mdash;Said another, In what street?&mdash;In Russel-street,
answered I.&mdash;Lord, says another, I'm sure there
was never a fine new sign there yesterday.&mdash;Yes, but
there was, said I again; and it came out of France, and
has been there a fortnight.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> A pox! I can hear no more, prithee.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, hear him out; let him tune his crowd
a while.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> The worst music, the greatest preparation.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, faith, I'll make you laugh.&mdash;It cannot be,
says a third lady.&mdash;Yes, yes, quoth I again.&mdash;Says a
fourth lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Look to't, we'll have no more ladies.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No&mdash;then mark, mark, now. Said I to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
fourth, Did you never see Mr. Horner? he lodges in
Russel-street, and he's a sign of a man, you know,
since he came out of France; ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But the devil take me if thine be the sign of a
jest.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> With that they all fell a-laughing, till they bepissed
themselves. What, but it does not move you, methinks?
Well, I see one had as good go to law without
a witness, as break a jest without a laugher on one's side.&mdash;Come,
come, sparks, but where do we dine? I have
left at Whitehall an earl, to dine with you.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Why, I thought thou hadst loved a man with a
title, better than a suit with a French trimming to't.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Go to him again.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, sir, a wit to me is the greatest title in the
world.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But go dine with your earl, sir; he may be exception.
We are your friends, and will not take it ill to
be left, I do assure you.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Nay, faith, he shall go to him.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, pray, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> We'll thrust you out, if you won't; what, disappoint
anybody for us?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, dear gentlemen, hear me.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, no, sir, by no means; pray go, sir.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Why, dear rogues&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, no. [<i>They all thrust him out of the room.</i></p>

<p><i>All.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But, sparks, pray hear me. What, d'ye think
I'll eat then with gay shallow fops and silent coxcombs? I
think wit as necessary at dinner, as a glass of good wine;
and that's the reason I never have any stomach when I
eat alone.&mdash;Come, but where do we dine?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Even where you will.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> At Chateline's?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, if you will.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Or at the Cock?<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Or at the Dog and Partridge?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, if you have a mind to't; for we shall dine
at neither.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! with your fooling we shall lose the new
play; and I would no more miss seeing a new play the
first day, than I would miss sitting in the wit's row.
Therefore I'll go fetch my mistress, and away. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Who have we here? Pinchwife?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Gentlemen, your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, Jack, by thy long absence from the town,
the grumness of thy countenance, and the slovenliness
of thy habit, I should give thee joy, should I not, of
marriage?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Death! does he know I'm married
too? I thought to have concealed it from him at least.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
My long stay in the country will excuse my
dress; and I have a suit of law that brings me up to
town, that puts me out of humour. Besides, I must give
Sparkish to-morrow five thousand pounds to lie with my
sister.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, you country gentlemen, rather than not
purchase, will buy anything; and he is a cracked title,
if we may quibble. Well, but am I to give thee joy? I
heard thou wert married.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What then?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, the next thing that is to be heard, is,
thou'rt a cuckold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Insupportable name! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But I did not expect marriage from such a
whoremaster as you; one that knew the town so much,
and women so well.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why, I have married no London wife.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Pshaw! that's all one. That grave circumspection
in marrying a country wife, is like refusing a
deceitful pampered Smithfield jade, to go and be cheated
by a friend in the country.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A pox on him and his simile!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
At least we are a little surer of the breed there, know
what her keeping has been, whether foiled or unsound.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come, come, I have known a clap gotten in
Wales; and there are cousins, justices' clerks, and chaplains
in the country, I won't say coachmen. But she's
handsome and young?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll answer as I should do.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
No, no; she has no beauty but her youth, no attraction
but her modesty: wholesome, homely, and huswifely;
that's all.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> He talks as like a grazier as he looks.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> She's too awkward, ill-favoured, and silly to bring
to town.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Then methinks you should bring her to be
taught breeding.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> To be taught! no, sir, I thank you. Good
wives and private soldiers should be ignorant&mdash;I'll keep
her from your instructions, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> The rogue is as jealous as if his wife were not
ignorant. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, if she be ill-favoured, there will be less
danger here for you than by leaving her in the country.
We have such variety of dainties that we are seldom
hungry.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But they have always coarse, constant, swingeing
stomachs in the country.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Foul feeders indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And your hospitality is great there.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Open house; every man's welcome.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So, so, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But prithee, why shouldst thou marry her? If
she be ugly, ill-bred, and silly, she must be rich then.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> As rich as if she brought me twenty thousand
pound out of this town; for she'll be as sure not to spend
her moderate portion, as a London baggage would be to
spend hers, let it be what it would: so 'tis all one. Then,
because she's ugly, she's the likelier to be my own; and
being ill-bred, she'll hate conversation; and since silly
and innocent, will not know the difference betwixt a man
of one-and-twenty and one of forty.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nine&mdash;to my knowledge. But if she be silly,
she'll expect as much from a man of forty-nine, as from
him of one-and-twenty. But methinks wit is more necessary
than beauty; and I think no young woman ugly that
has it, and no handsome woman agreeable without it.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis my maxim, he's a fool that marries; but
he's a greater that does not marry a fool. What is wit in
a wife good for, but to make a man a cuckold?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes, to keep it from his knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> A fool cannot contrive to make her husband a
cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No; but she'll club with a man that can: and
what is worse, if she cannot make her husband a cuckold,
she'll make him jealous, and pass for one: and then 'tis
all one.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, well, I'll take care for one. My wife
shall make me no cuckold, though she had your help,
Mr. Horner. I understand the town, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> His help! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> He's come newly to town, it seems, and has not
heard how things are with him. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But tell me, has marriage cured thee of whoring,
which it seldom does?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> 'Tis more than age can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, the word is, I'll marry and live honest: but
a marriage vow is like a penitent gamester's oath, and
entering into bonds and penalties to stint himself to such
a particular small sum at play for the future, which makes
him but the more eager; and not being able to hold out,
loses his money again, and his forfeit to boot.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, ay, a gamester will be a gamester whilst his
money lasts, and a whoremaster whilst his vigour.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Nay, I have known 'em, when they are broke,
and can lose no more, keep a fumbling with the box in
their hands to fool with only, and hinder other gamesters.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> That had wherewithal to make lusty stakes.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, gentlemen, you may laugh at me; but
you shall never lie with my wife: I know the town.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But prithee, was not the way you were in
better? is not keeping better than marriage?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> A pox on't! the jades would jilt me, I could
never keep a whore to myself.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, then you only married to keep a whore to
yourself. Well, but let me tell you, women, as you say,
are like soldiers, made constant and loyal by good pay,
rather than by oaths and covenants. Therefore I'd
advise my friends to keep rather than marry, since too
I find, by your example, it does not serve one's turn; for
I saw you yesterday in the eighteenpenny place with a
pretty country-wench.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How the devil! did he see my wife then? I
sat there that she might not be seen. But she shall
never go to a play again. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What! dost thou blush, at nine-and-forty, for
having been seen with a wench?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, faith, I warrant 'twas his wife, which he
seated there out of sight; for he's a cunning rogue, and
understands the town.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> He blushes. Then 'twas his wife; for men are
now more ashamed to be seen with them in public than
with a wench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Hell and damnation! I'm undone, since
Horner has seen her, and they know 'twas she.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But prithee, was it thy wife? She was exceeding
pretty: I was in love with her at that distance.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> You are like never to be nearer to her. Your
servant, gentlemen. [<i>Offers to go.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, prithee stay.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I cannot; I will not.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come, you shall dine with us.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I have dined already.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come, I know thou hast not: I'll treat thee,
dear rogue; thou sha't spend none of thy Hampshire
money to-day.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Treat me! So, he uses me already like his
cuckold. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, you shall not go.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I must; I have business at home. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> To beat his wife. He's as jealous of her, as a
Cheapside husband of a Covent-garden wife.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, 'tis as hard to find an old whoremaster
without jealousy and the gout, as a young one without
fear, or the pox:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As gout in age from pox in youth proceeds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So wenching past, then jealousy succeeds;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The worst disease that love and wenching breeds.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I <i>.&mdash;A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Margery Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea. Pinchwife</span>
<i>peeping behind at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray, sister, where are the
best fields and woods to walk in, in
London?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A pretty question!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Why, sister, Mulberry-garden
and St. James's park; and, for
close walks, the New Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray, sister, tell me why my husband
looks so grum here in town, and keeps me up so close,
and will not let me go a-walking, nor let me wear my best
gown yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> O, he's jealous, sister.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Jealous! what's that?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He's afraid you should love another man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> How should he be afraid of my loving
another man, when he will not let me see any but
himself?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Did he not carry you yesterday to a play?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Ay; but we sat amongst ugly people.
He would not let me come near the gentry, who sat under
us, so that I could not see 'em. He told me, none but
naughty women sat there, whom they toused and moused.
But I would have ventured, for all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> But how did you like the play?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Indeed I was weary of the play; but I
liked hugeously the actors. They are the goodliest,
properest men, sister!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> O, but you must not like the actors, sister.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Ay, how should I help it, sister? Pray,
sister, when my husband comes in, will you ask leave for
me to go a-walking?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> A-walking! ha! ha! Lord, a country-gentlewoman's
pleasure is the drudgery of a footpost; and she
requires as much airing as her husband's horses.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
But here comes your husband: I'll ask, though I'm sure
he'll not grant it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> He says he won't let me go abroad for
fear of catching the pox.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Fy! the small-pox you should say.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O my dear, dear bud, welcome home!
Why dost thou look so fropish? who has nangered thee?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> You're a fool.
[Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>goes aside, and cries.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Faith, so she is, for crying for no fault, poor
tender creature!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, you would have her as impudent as
yourself, as arrant a jilflirt, a gadder, a magpie; and to
say all, a mere notorious town-woman?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Brother, you are my only censurer; and the
honour of your family will sooner suffer in your wife there
than in me, though I take the innocent liberty of the
town.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Hark you, mistress, do not talk so before my
wife.&mdash;The innocent liberty of the town!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Why, pray, who boasts of any intrigue with me?
what lampoon has made my name notorious? what ill
women frequent my lodgings? I keep no company with
any women of scandalous reputations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, you keep the men of scandalous reputations
company.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Where? would you not have me civil? answer
'em in a box at the plays, in the drawing-room at
Whitehall, in St James'-park, Mulberry-garden, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Hold, hold! Do not teach my wife where the
men are to be found: I believe she's the worse for your
town-documents already. I bid you keep her in ignorance,
as I do.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Indeed, be not angry with her, bud, she
will tell me nothing of the town, though I ask her a
thousand times a day.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Then you are very inquisitive to know, I
find?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Not I indeed, dear; I hate London.
Our place-house in the country is worth a thousand of't:
would I were there again!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So you shall, I warrant. But were you not
talking of plays and players when I came in?&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.] You are her encourager in such discourses.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> No, indeed, dear; she chid me just now
for liking the playermen.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Nay, if she be so innocent as to own to
me her liking them, there is no hurt in't.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Come, my poor rogue, but thou likest none better than
me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, indeed, but I do. The playermen
are finer folks.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But you love none better than me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> You are my own dear bud, and I know
you. I hate a stranger.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Ay, my dear, you must love me only; and not
be like the naughty town-women, who only hate their
husbands, and love every man else; love plays, visits,
fine coaches, fine clothes, fiddles, balls, treats, and so
lead a wicked town-life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, if to enjoy all these things be a
town-life, London is not so bad a place, dear.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How! if you love me, you must hate London.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> The fool has forbid me discovering to her the
pleasures of the town, and he is now setting her agog
upon them himself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But, husband, do the town-women love
the playermen too?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Ay, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why, you do not, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> No, no, bud. But why have we no playermen
in the country?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Ha!&mdash;Mrs. Minx, ask me no more to go to a
play.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, why, love? I did not care for going:
but when you forbid me, you make me, as 'twere, desire
it.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> So 'twill be in other things, I warrant. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray let me go to a play, dear.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Hold your peace, I wo' not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, love?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why, I'll tell you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Nay, if he tell her, she'll give him more cause
to forbid her that place. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray why, dear?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> First, you like the actors; and the gallants may
like you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What, a homely country girl! No, bud,
nobody will like me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I tell you yes, they may.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> No, no, you jest&mdash;I won't believe you:
I will go.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I tell you then, that one of the lewdest fellows
in town, who saw you there, told me he was in love with
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Indeed! who, who, pray who was't?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I've gone too far, and slipped before I was
aware; how overjoyed she is! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Was it any Hampshire gallant, any of our
neighbours? I promise you, I am beholden to him.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I promise you, you lie; for he would but ruin
you, as he has done hundreds. He has no other love
for women but that; such as he look upon women, like
basilisks, but to destroy 'em.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch</i> Ay, but if he loves me, why should he
ruin me? answer me to that. Methinks he should not,
I would do him no harm.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis very well; but I'll keep him from doing
you any harm, or me either. But here comes company;
get you in, get you in.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But, pray, husband, is he a pretty gentleman
that loves me?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> In, baggage, in.
[<i>Thrusts her in, and shuts the door.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>.</p>

<p>What, all the lewd libertines of the town brought to my
lodging by this easy coxcomb! 'sdeath, I'll not suffer it.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Here, Harcourt, do you approve my choice?&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.] Dear little rogue, I told you I'd bring
you acquainted with all my friends, the wits and&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
<i>salutes her.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Ay, they shall know her, as well as you yourself
will, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> This is one of those, my pretty rogue, that are
to dance at your wedding to-morrow; and him you must
bid welcome ever, to what you and I have.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Monstrous! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Harcourt, how dost thou like her, faith? Nay,
dear, do not look down; I should hate to have a wife of
mine out of countenance at anything.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Wonderful! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Tell me, I say, Harcourt, how dost thou like
her? Thou hast stared upon her enough, to resolve
me.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> So infinitely well, that I could wish I had a
mistress too, that might differ from her in nothing but
her love and engagement to you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Sir, Master Sparkish has often told me that
his acquaintance were all wits and raillieurs, and now I
find it.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, by the universe, madam, he does not rally
now; you may believe him. I do assure you, he is the
honestest, worthiest, true-hearted gentlemen&mdash;a man of
such perfect honour, he would say nothing to a lady he
does not mean.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Praising another man to his mistress! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Sir, you are so beyond expectation obliging,
that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, egad, I am sure you do admire her extremely;
I see't in your eyes.&mdash;He does admire you,
madam.&mdash;By the world, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Yes, above the world, or the most glorious part
of it, her whole sex: and till now I never thought I
should have envied you, or any man about to marry,
but you have the best excuse for marriage I ever knew.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Nay, now, sir, I'm satisfied you are of the society
of the wits and raillieurs, since you cannot spare your
friend, even when he is but too civil to you; but the
surest sign is, since you are an enemy to marriage,&mdash;for
that I hear you hate as much as business or bad
wine.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Truly, madam, I was never an enemy to marriage
till now, because marriage was never an enemy to me
before.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> But why, sir, is marriage an enemy to you now?
because it robs you of your friend here? for you look
upon a friend married, as one gone into a monastery,
that is, dead to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> 'Tis indeed, because you marry him; I see,
madam, you can guess my meaning. I do confess
heartily and openly, I wish it were in my power to break
the match; by Heavens I would.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Poor Frank!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Would you be so unkind to me?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, no, 'tis not because I would be unkind to
you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Poor Frank! no gad, 'tis only his kindness to
me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Great kindness to you indeed! Insensible fop,
let a man make love to his wife to his face! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, dear Frank, for all my wife there, that
shall be, thou shalt enjoy me sometimes, dear rogue.
By my honour, we men of wit condole for our deceased
brother in marriage, as much as for one dead in earnest:
I think that was prettily said of me, ha, Harcourt?&mdash;But
come, Frank, be not melancholy for me.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, I assure you, I am not melancholy for you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Prithee, Frank, dost think my wife that shall
be there, a fine person?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I could gaze upon her till I became as blind as
you are.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How as I am? how?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Because you are a lover, and true lovers are
blind, stock blind.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> True, true; but by the world she has wit too,
as well as beauty: go, go with her into a corner, and
try if she has wit; talk to her anything, she's bashful
before me.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Indeed if a woman wants wit in a corner, she
has it nowhere.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Sir, you dispose of me a little before your
time&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, nay, madam, let me have an earnest of
your obedience, or&mdash;go, go, madam&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
<i>courts</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How, sir! if you are not concerned for the
honour of a wife, I am for that of a sister; he shall not
debauch her. Be a pander to your own wife! bring men
to her! let 'em make love before your face! thrust 'em
into a corner together, then leave 'em in private! is this
your town wit and conduct?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ha! ha! ha! a silly wise rogue would make
one laugh more than a stark fool, ha! ha! I shall burst.
Nay, you shall not disturb 'em; I'll vex thee, by the world.
[<i>Struggles with</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>to keep him from</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> The writings are drawn, sir, settlements made;
'tis too late, sir, and past all revocation.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Then so is my death.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I would not be unjust to him.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Then why to me so?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I have no obligation to you.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> My love.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I had his before.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> You never had it; he wants, you see, jealousy,
the only infallible sign of it.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Love proceeds from esteem; he cannot distrust
my virtue: besides, he loves me, or he would not marry
me.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Marrying you is no more sign of his love than
bribing your woman, that he may marry you, is a sign of
his generosity. Marriage is rather a sign of interest than
love; and he that marries a fortune covets a mistress, not
loves her. But if you take marriage for a sign of love,
take it from me immediately.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> No, now you have put a scruple in my head;
but in short, sir, to end our dispute, I must marry him,
my reputation would suffer in the world else.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No; if you do marry him, with your pardon,
madam, your reputation suffers in the world, and you
would be thought in necessity for a cloak.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Nay, now you are rude, sir.&mdash;Mr. Sparkish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
pray come hither, your friend here is very troublesome,
and very loving.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Hold! hold!&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> D'ye hear that?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Why, d'ye think I'll seem to be jealous, like a
country bumpkin?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, rather be a cuckold, like a credulous cit.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Madam, you would not have been so little
generous as to have told him.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Yes, since you could be so little generous as to
wrong him.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Wrong him! no man can do't, he's beneath an
injury: a bubble, a coward, a senseless idiot, a wretch so
contemptible to all the world but you, that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Hold, do not rail at him, for since he is like to
be my husband, I am resolved to like him: nay, I think
I am obliged to tell him you are not his friend.&mdash;Master
Sparkish, Master Sparkish!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What, what?&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>.] Now, dear
rogue, has not she wit?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Not so much as I thought, and hoped she had.
[<i>Speaks surlily.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Mr. Sparkish, do you bring people to rail at you?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How! no; but if he does rail at me, 'tis but in
jest, I warrant: what we wits do for one another, and
never take any notice of it.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He spoke so scurrilously of you, I had no
patience to hear him; besides, he has been making love
to me.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> True, damned tell-tale woman! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! to show his parts&mdash;we wits rail and
make love often, but to show our parts: as we have no
affections, so we have no malice, we&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He said you were a wretch below an injury&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Damned, senseless, impudent, virtuous jade!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Well, since she won't let me have her, she'll do as good,
she'll make me hate her. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> A common bubble&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> A coward&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw, pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> A senseless, drivelling idiot&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How! did he disparage my parts? Nay, then,
my honour's concerned, I can't put up that, sir, by the
world&mdash;brother, help me to kill him&mdash;[<i>Aside</i>] I may draw
now, since we have the odds of him:&mdash;'tis a good
occasion, too, before my mistress&mdash;[<i>Offers to draw.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Hold, hold!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What, what?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I must not let 'em kill the gentleman
neither, for his kindness to me: I am so far from hating
him, that I wish my gallant had his person and understanding.
Nay, if my honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> I'll be thy death.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Hold, hold! Indeed, to tell the truth, the
gentleman said after all, that what he spoke was but out
of friendship to you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How! say, I am, I am a fool, that is, no wit,
out of friendship to me?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Yes, to try whether I was concerned enough
for you; and made love to me only to be satisfied of my
virtue, for your sake.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Kind, however. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, if it were so, my dear rogue, I ask thee
pardon; but why would not you tell me so, faith?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Because I did not think on't, faith.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, Horner does not come; Harcourt, let's
be gone to the new play.&mdash;Come, madam.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I will not go, if you intend to leave me alone in
the box, and run into the pit, as you use to do.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! I'll leave Harcourt with you in the
box to entertain you, and that's as good; if I sat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
box, I should be thought no judge but of trimmings.&mdash;Come
away, Harcourt, lead her down.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish, Harcourt</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, go thy ways, for the flower of the true
town fops, such as spend their estates before they come
to 'em, and are cuckolds before they're married. But
let me go look to my own freehold.&mdash;How!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dainty Fidget</span>, <i>and</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Squeamish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Your servant, sir: where is your lady? We
are come to wait upon her to the new play.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> New play!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> And my husband will wait upon you
presently.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Damn your civility.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Madam,
by no means; I will not see Sir Jasper here, till I have
waited upon him at home; nor shall my wife see you till
she has waited upon your ladyship at your lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Now we are here, sir?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Pray, let us see her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> We will not stir till we see her.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A pox on you all!&mdash;[<i>Goes to the door,
and returns.</i>] She has locked the door, and is gone
abroad.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> No, you have locked the door, and she's
within.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> They told us below she was here.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Will nothing do?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Well, it
must out then. To tell you the truth, ladies, which I was
afraid to let you know before, lest it might endanger your
lives, my wife has just now the small-pox come out upon
her; do not be frightened; but pray be gone, ladies;
you shall not stay here in danger of your lives; pray get
you gone, ladies.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> No, no, we have all had 'em.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Alack, alack!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Come, come, we must see how it goes with
her; I understand the disease.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Come!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, there is no being too hard for
women at their own weapon, lying, therefore I'll quit the
field. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Here's an example of jealousy!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Indeed, as the world goes, I wonder there
are no more jealous, since wives are so neglected.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Pshaw! as the world goes, to what end
should they be jealous?</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Foh! 'tis a nasty world.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> That men of parts, great acquaintance,
and quality, should take up with and spend themselves
and fortunes in keeping little playhouse creatures, foh!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Nay, that women of understanding, great
acquaintance, and good quality, should fall a-keeping too
of little creatures, foh!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Why, 'tis the men of quality's fault; they
never visit women of honour and reputation as they used
to do; and have not so much as common civility for
ladies of our rank, but use us with the same indifferency
and ill-breeding as if we were all married to 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> She says true; 'tis an arrant shame women
of quality should be so slighted; methinks birth&mdash;birth
should go for something; I have known men admired,
courted, and followed for their titles only.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Ay, one would think men of honour
should not love, no more than marry, out of their own
rank.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Fy, fy, upon 'em! they are come to think
cross breeding for themselves best, as well as for their dogs
and horses.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> They are dogs and horses for't.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> One would think, if not for love, for
vanity a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Nay, they do satisfy their vanity upon us
sometimes; and are kind to us in their report, tell all the
world they lie with us.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Damned rascals, that we should be only
wronged by 'em! To report a man has had a person,
when he has not had a person, is the greatest wrong in
the whole world that can be done to a person.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Well, 'tis an arrant shame noble persons
should be so wronged and neglected.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But still 'tis an arranter shame for a noble
person to neglect her own honour, and defame her own
noble person with little inconsiderable fellows, foh!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> I suppose the crime against our honour is
the same with a man of quality as with another.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> How! no sure, the man of quality is likest
one's husband, and therefore the fault should be the less.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> But then the pleasure should be the less.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Fy, fy, fy, for shame, sister! whither shall
we ramble? Be continent in your discourse, or I shall
hate you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Besides, an intrigue is so much the more
notorious for the man's quality.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> 'Tis true that nobody takes notice of a
private man, and therefore with him 'tis more secret; and
the crime's the less when 'tis not known.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> You say true; i'faith, I think you are in the
right on't: 'tis not an injury to a husband, till it be an
injury to our honours; so that a woman of honour loses
no honour with a private person; and to say truth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> So, the little fellow is grown a private person&mdash;with
her&mdash;[<i>Apart to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Squeamish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But still my dear, dear honour&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget, Horner</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ay, my dear, dear of honour, thou hast still
so much honour in thy mouth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> That she has none elsewhere. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Oh, what d'ye mean to bring in these upon
us?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Foh! these are as bad as wits.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Foh!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Let us leave the room.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Stay, stay; faith, to tell you the naked
truth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Fy, Sir Jasper! do not use that word
naked.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Well, well, in short I have business at Whitehall,
and cannot go to the play with you, therefore would
have you go&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> With those two to a play?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No, not with t'other, but with Mr. Horner;
there can be no more scandal to go with him than with
Mr. Tattle, or Master Limberham.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> With that nasty fellow! no&mdash;no.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Nay, prithee, dear, hear me.
[<i>Whispers to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ladies&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Horner</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span> <i>draw near</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Squeamish</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dainty Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Stand off.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Do not approach us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> You herd with the wits, you are obscenity all
over.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And I would as soon look upon a
picture of Adam and Eve, without fig-leaves, as any of
you, if I could help it; therefore keep off, and do not
make us sick.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What a devil are these?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, these are pretenders to honour, as critics
to wit, only by censuring others; and as every raw,
peevish, out-of-humoured, affected, dull, tea-drinking,
arithmetical fop, sets up for a wit by railing at men of
sense, so these for honour, by railing at the court, and
ladies of as great honour as quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Come, Mr. Horner, I must desire you to go
with these ladies to the play, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ay, ay, come, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I must beg your pardon, sir, and theirs; I will
not be seen in women's company in public again for the
world.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha, ha, strange aversion!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> No, he's for women's company in
private.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He&mdash;poor man&mdash;he&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> 'Tis a greater shame amongst lewd fellows
to be seen in virtuous women's company, than for the
women to be seen with them.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Indeed, madam, the time was I only hated
virtuous women, but now I hate the other too; I beg
your pardon, ladies.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> You are very obliging, sir, because we would
not be troubled with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> In sober sadness, he shall go.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, if he wo' not, I am ready to wait upon the
ladies, and I think I am the fitter man.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> You sir! no, I thank you for that. Master
Horner is a privileged man amongst the virtuous ladies,
'twill be a great while before you are so; he! he! he! he's
my wife's gallant; he! he! he! No, pray withdraw, sir, for
as I take it, the virtuous ladies have no business with
you.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And I am sure he can have none with them.
'Tis strange a man can't come amongst virtuous women
now, but upon the same terms as men are admitted into
the Great Turk's seraglio. But heavens keep me from
being an ombre player with 'em!&mdash;But where is Pinchwife?
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Come, come, man; what, avoid the sweet
society of womankind? that sweet, soft, gentle, tame,
noble creature, woman, made for man's companion&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So is that soft, gentle, tame, and more noble
creature a spaniel, and has all their tricks; can fawn, lie
down, suffer beating, and fawn the more; barks at your
friends when they come to see you, makes your bed hard,
gives you fleas, and the mange sometimes. And all the
difference is, the spaniel's the more faithful animal, and
fawns but upon one master.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He! he! he!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> O the rude beast!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Insolent brute!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Brute! stinking, mortified, rotten French
wether, to dare&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Hold, an't please your ladyship.&mdash;For shame,
Master Horner! your mother was a woman&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
Now shall I never reconcile 'em.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Fidget</span>.] Hark you, madam, take my advice in your anger.
You know you often want one to make up your drolling
pack of ombre players, and you may cheat him easily;
for he's an ill gamester, and consequently loves play.
Besides, you know you have but two old civil gentlemen
(with stinking breaths too) to wait upon you abroad;
take in the third into your service. The other are but
crazy; and a lady should have a supernumerary gentleman-usher
as a supernumerary coach-horse, lest sometimes
you should be forced to stay at home.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But are you sure he loves play, and has
money?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He loves play as much as you, and has
money as much as I.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Then I am contented to make him pay for
his scurrility. Money makes up in a measure all other
wants in men.&mdash;Those whom we cannot make hold for
gallants, we make fine. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, so; now to mollify, wheedle
him.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] Master Horner, will you
never keep civil company? methinks 'tis time now, since
you are only fit for them. Come, come, man, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
e'en fall to visiting our wives, eating at our tables, drinking
tea with our virtuous relations after dinner, dealing
cards to 'em, reading plays and gazettes to 'em, picking
fleas out of their smocks for 'em, collecting receipts, new
songs, women, pages, and footmen for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I hope they'll afford me better employment, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He! he! he! 'tis fit you know your work
before you come into your place. And since you are
unprovided of a lady to flatter, and a good house to eat
at, pray frequent mine, and call my wife mistress, and
she shall call you gallant, according to the custom.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Who, I?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Faith, thou sha't for my sake; come, for my
sake only.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> For your sake&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Come, come, here's a gamester for you; let
him be a little familiar sometimes; nay, what if a little
rude? Gamesters may be rude with ladies, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Yes; losing gamesters have a privilege with
women.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I always thought the contrary, that the winning
gamester had most privilege with women; for when you
have lost your money to a man, you'll lose anything you
have, all you have, they say, and he may use you as he
pleases.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He! he! he! well, win or lose, you shall
have your liberty with her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> As he behaves himself; and for your sake
I'll give him admittance and freedom.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> All sorts of freedom, madam?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ay, ay, ay, all sorts of freedom thou canst
take. And so go to her, begin thy new employment;
wheedle her, jest with her, and be better acquainted one
with another.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I think I know her already; therefore
may venture with her my secret for hers.
[<span class="smcap">Horner</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span> <i>whisper.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Sister cuz, I have provided an innocent playfellow
for you there.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Who, he?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> There's a playfellow, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Yes sure.&mdash;What, he is good enough to play
at cards, blindman's-buff, or the fool with, sometimes!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Foh! we'll have no such playfellows.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> No, sir; you shan't choose playfellows for
us, we thank you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Nay, pray hear me. [<i>Whispering to them.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But, poor gentleman, could you be so
generous, so truly a man of honour, as for the sakes of us
women of honour, to cause yourself to be reported no
man? No man! and to suffer yourself the greatest
shame that could fall upon a man, that none might fall
upon us women by your conversation? but, indeed, sir,
as perfectly, perfectly the same man as before your going
into France, sir? as perfectly, perfectly, sir?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> As perfectly, perfectly, madam. Nay, I scorn
you should take my word; I desire to be tried only,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Well, that's spoken again like a man of
honour: all men of honour desire to come to the test.
But, indeed, generally you men report such things of
yourselves, one does not know how or whom to believe;
and it is come to that pass, we dare not take your words
no more than your tailor's, without some staid servant of
yours be bound with you. But I have so strong a faith
in your honour, dear, dear, noble sir, that I'd forfeit mine
for yours, at any time, dear sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, madam, you should not need to forfeit it for
me; I have given you security already to save you harmless,
my late reputation being so well known in the world,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But if upon any future falling-out, or upon
a suspicion of my taking the trust out of your hands, to
employ some other, you yourself should betray your trust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
dear sir? I mean, if you'll give me leave to speak
obscenely, you might tell, dear sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> If I did, nobody would believe me. The
reputation of impotency is as hardly recovered again in
the world as that of cowardice, dear madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Nay, then, as one may say, you may do
your worst, dear, dear sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Come, is your ladyship reconciled to him
yet? have you agreed on matters? for I must be gone to
Whitehall.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Why, indeed, Sir Jasper, Master Horner is
a thousand, thousand times a better man than I thought
him. Cousin Squeamish, sister Dainty, I can name him
now. Truly, not long ago, you know, I thought his very
name obscenity; and I would as soon have lain with him
as have named him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Very likely, poor madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> I believe it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> No doubt on't.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Well, well&mdash;that your ladyship is as virtuous
as any she, I know, and him all the town knows&mdash;he! he!
he! therefore now you like him, get you gone to your
business together, go, go to your business, I say, pleasure,
whilst I go to my pleasure, business.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Come, then, dear gallant.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come away, my dearest mistress.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> So, so; why, 'tis as I'd have it. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And as I'd have it.</p>

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Sister, what ails you? you are
grown melancholy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Would it not make any
one melancholy to see you go every
day fluttering about abroad, whilst I
must stay at home like a poor lonely
sullen bird in a cage?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Ay, sister; but you came young, and just from
the nest to your cage: so that I thought you liked it, and
could be as cheerful in't as others that took their flight
themselves early, and are hopping abroad in the open
air.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, I confess I was quiet enough till my
husband told me what pure lives the London ladies live
abroad, with their dancing, meetings, and junketings, and
dressed every day in their best gowns; and I warrant
you, play at nine-pins every day of the week, so they do.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, what's here to do? you are putting the
town-pleasures in her head, and setting her a-longing.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Yes, after nine-pins. You suffer none to give
her those longings you mean but yourself.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I tell her of the vanities of the town like a
confessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> A confessor! just such a confessor as he that,
by forbidding a silly ostler to grease the horse's teeth,
taught him to do't.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, Mrs. Flippant, good precepts are lost
when bad examples are still before us: the liberty you
take abroad makes her hanker after it, and out of humour
at home. Poor wretch! she desired not to come to
London; I would bring her.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> She has been this week in town, and never desired
till this afternoon to go abroad.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Was she not at a play yesterday?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes; but she ne'er asked me; I was myself the
cause of her going.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Then if she ask you again, you are the cause of
her asking, and not my example.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, to-morrow night I shall be rid of you;
and the next day, before 'tis light, she and I'll be rid of
the town, and my dreadful apprehensions.&mdash;Come, be not
melancholy; for thou sha't go into the country after
to-morrow, dearest.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Great comfort!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pish! what d'ye tell me of the country for?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How's this! what, pish at the country?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Let me alone; I am not well.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> O, if that be all&mdash;what ails my dearest?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Truly, I don't know: but I have not been
well since you told me there was a gallant at the play in
love with me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Ha!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> That's by my example too!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Nay, if you are not well, but are so concerned,
because a lewd fellow chanced to lie, and say he liked
you, you'll make me sick too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Of what sickness?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> O, of that which is worse than the plague,
jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pish, you jeer! I'm sure there's no such
disease in our receipt-book at home.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, thou never met'st with it, poor innocent.&mdash;Well,
if thou cuckold me, 'twill be my own fault&mdash;for
cuckolds and bastards are generally makers of their own
fortune. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Well, but pray, bud, let's go to a play to-night.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis just done, she comes from it. But why are
you so eager to see a play?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Faith, dear, not that I care one pin for
their talk there; but I like to look upon the player-men,
and would see, if I could, the gallant you say loves me:
that's all, dear bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Is that all, dear bud?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> This proceeds from my example!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But if the play be done, let's go abroad,
however, dear bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come have a little patience and thou shalt go
into the country on Friday.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Therefore I would see first some sights to
tell my neighbours of. Nay, I will go abroad, that's once.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I'm the cause of this desire too!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But now I think on't, who, who was the cause
of Horner's coming to my lodgings to-day? That was
you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> No, you, because you would not let him see
your handsome wife out of your lodging.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, O Lord! did the gentleman come
hither to see me indeed?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, no.&mdash;You are not the cause of that damned
question too, Mistress Alithea?&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Well, she's in
the right of it. He is in love with my wife&mdash;and comes
after her&mdash;'tis so&mdash;but I'll nip his love in the bud; lest
he should follow us into the country, and break his
chariot-wheel near our house, on purpose for an excuse
to come to't. But I think I know the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Come, pray, bud, let's go abroad before
'tis late; for I will go, that's flat and plain.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So! the obstinacy already of the town-wife;
and I must, whilst she's here, humour her like one.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Sister, how shall we do, that she may not be
seen, or known?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Let her put on her mask.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Pshaw! a mask makes people but the more
inquisitive, and is as ridiculous a disguise as a stage-beard:
her shape, stature, habit will be known. And if
we should meet with Horner, he would be sure to take
acquaintance with us, must wish her joy, kiss her, talk to
her, leer upon her, and the devil and all. No, I'll not
use her to a mask, 'tis dangerous; for masks have made
more cuckolds than the best faces that ever were known.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> How will you do then?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, shall we go? The Exchange will
be shut, and I have a mind to see that.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So&mdash;I have it&mdash;I'll dress her up in the suit we
are to carry down to her brother, little Sir James; nay, I
understand the town-tricks. Come, let's go dress her.
A mask! no&mdash;a woman masked, like a covered dish,
gives a man curiosity and appetite; when, it may be,
uncovered, 'twould turn his stomach: no, no.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Indeed your comparison is something a greasy
one: but I had a gentle gallant used to say, A beauty
masked, like the sun in eclipse, gathers together more
gazers than if it shined out. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The New Exchange.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Horner, Harcourt</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Engaged to women, and not sup with us!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, a pox on 'em all!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> You were much a more reasonable man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
morning, and had as noble resolutions against 'em, as a
widower of a week's liberty.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Did I ever think to see you keep company with
women in vain?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> In vain: no&mdash;'tis since I can't love 'em, to be
revenged on 'em.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Now your sting is gone, you looked in the box
amongst all those women like a drone in the hive; all
upon you, shoved and ill-used by 'em all, and thrust from
one side to t'other.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yet he must be buzzing amongst 'em still, like
other beetle-headed liquorish drones. Avoid 'em, and
hate 'em, as they hate you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Because I do hate 'em, and would hate 'em yet
more, I'll frequent 'em. You may see by marriage,
nothing makes a man hate a woman more than her
constant conversation. In short, I converse with 'em,
as you do with rich fools, to laugh at 'em and use 'em
ill.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But I would no more sup with women, unless I
could lie with 'em, than sup with a rich coxcomb, unless
I could cheat him.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes, I have known thee sup with a fool for his
drinking; if he could set out your hand that way only,
you were satisfied, and if he were a wine-swallowing
mouth, 'twas enough.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Yes, a man drinks often with a fool, as he tosses
with a marker, only to keep his hand in use. But do the
ladies drink?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes, sir; and I shall have the pleasure at least
of laying 'em flat with a bottle, and bring as much scandal
that way upon 'em as formerly t'other.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Perhaps you may prove as weak a brother among
'em that way as t'other.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Foh! drinking with women is as unnatural as
scolding with 'em. But 'tis a pleasure of decayed fornicators,
and the basest way of quenching love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Nay, 'tis drowning love, instead of quenching it.
But leave us for civil women too!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, when he can't be the better for 'em. We
hardly pardon a man that leaves his friend for a wench,
and that's a pretty lawful call.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Faith, I would not leave you for 'em, if they
would not drink.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Who would disappoint his company at Lewis's
for a gossiping?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Foh! Wine and women, good apart, together are
as nauseous as sack and sugar. But hark you, sir, before
you go, a little of your advice; an old maimed general,
when unfit for action, is fittest for counsel. I have other
designs upon women than eating and drinking with them;
I am in love with Sparkish's mistress, whom he is to marry
to-morrow: now how shall I get her?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>, <i>looking about.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, here comes one will help you to her.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> He! he, I tell you, is my rival, and will hinder
my love.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No; a foolish rival and a jealous husband
assist their rival's designs; for they are sure to make
their women hate them, which is the first step to their
love for another man.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But I cannot come near his mistress but in his
company.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Still the better for you; for fools are most easily
cheated when they themselves are accessories: and he is
to be bubbled of his mistress as of his money, the
common mistress, by keeping him company.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Who is that that is to be bubbled? Faith, let
me snack; I han't met with a bubble since Christmas.
'Gad, I think bubbles are like their brother woodcocks,
go out with the cold weather.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> A pox! he did not hear all, I hope.
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, you bubbling rogues you, where do we
sup?&mdash;Oh, Harcourt, my mistress tells me you have
been making fierce love to her all the play long: ha!
ha!&mdash;But I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I make love to her!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, I forgive thee, for I think I know thee,
and I know her; but I am sure I know myself.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Did she tell you so? I see all women are like
these of the Exchange; who, to enhance the prize of
their commodities, report to their fond customers offers
which were never made 'em.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, women are apt to tell before the intrigue,
as men after it, and so show themselves the vainer sex.
But hast thou a mistress, Sparkish? 'Tis as hard for me
to believe it, as that thou ever hadst a bubble, as you
bragged just now.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> O, your servant, sir: are you at your raillery,
sir? But we are some of us beforehand with you to-day
at the play. The wits were something bold with you,
sir; did you not hear us laugh?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes; but I thought you had gone to plays, to
laugh at the poet's wit, not at your own.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Your servant, sir: no, I thank you. 'Gad I go
to a play as to a country treat; I carry my own wine to
one, and my own wit to t'other, or else I'm sure I should
not be merry at either. And the reason why we are so
often louder than the players, is, because we think we
speak more wit, and so become the poet's rivals in his
audience: for to tell you the truth, we hate the silly
rogues; nay, so much, that we find fault even with their
bawdy upon the stage, whilst we talk nothing else in the
pit as loud.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But why shouldst thou hate the silly poets?
Thou hast too much wit to be one; and they, like
whores, are only hated by each other: and thou dost
scorn writing, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Yes; I'd have you to know I scorn writing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
but women, women, that make men do all foolish things,
make 'em write songs too. Everybody does it. 'Tis
even as common with lovers, as playing with fans; and
you can no more help rhyming to your Phillis, than
drinking to your Phillis.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Nay, poetry in love is no more to be avoided
than jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But the poets damned your songs, did they?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Damn the poets! they have turned 'em into
burlesque, as they call it. That burlesque is a hocus-pocus
trick they have got, which, by the virtue of <i>Hictius
doctius topsy turvy</i>, they make a wise and witty man in
the world, a fool upon the stage you know not how: and
'tis therefore I hate 'em too, for I know not but it may
be my own case; for they'll put a man into a play for
looking asquint. Their predecessors were contented to
make serving-men only their stage-fools: but these rogues
must have gentlemen, with a pox to 'em, nay, knights;
and, indeed, you shall hardly see a fool upon the stage
but he's a knight. And to tell you the truth, they have
kept me these six years from being a knight in earnest,
for fear of being knighted in a play, and dubbed a fool.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Blame 'em not, they must follow their copy, the
age.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But why shouldst thou be afraid of being in a
play, who expose yourself every day in the play-houses,
and at public places?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> 'Tis but being on the stage, instead of standing
on a bench in the pit.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Don't you give money to painters to draw you
like? and are you afraid of your pictures at length in a
playhouse, where all your mistresses may see you?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> A pox! painters don't draw the small-pox or
pimples in one's face. Come, damn all your silly authors
whatever, all books and booksellers, by the world; and
all readers, courteous or uncourteous!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But who comes here, Sparkish?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>in man's clothes</i>,
<span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Oh, hide me! There's my mistress too.
[<span class="smcap">Sparkish</span> <i>hides himself behind</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> She sees you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But I will not see her. 'Tis time to go to
Whitehall, and I must not fail the drawing-room.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Pray, first carry me, and reconcile me to her.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Another time. Faith, the king will have
supped.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Not with the worse stomach for thy absence.
Thou art one of those fools that think their attendance
at the king's meals as necessary as his physicians, when
you are more troublesome to him than his doctors or his
dogs.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! I know my interest, sir. Prithee hide
me.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Your servant, Pinchwife.&mdash;What, he knows us
not!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come along. [<i>To his</i> Wife <i>aside</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray, have you any ballads? give me sixpenny
worth.</p>

<p><i>Bookseller.</i> We have no ballads.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Then give me "Covent Garden Drollery,"
and a play or two&mdash;Oh, here's "Tarugo's Wiles," and
"The Slighted Maiden";<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> I'll have them.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No; plays are not for your reading. Come
along; will you discover yourself? [<i>Apart to her.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Who is that pretty youth with him, Sparkish?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> I believe his wife's brother, because he's something
like her: but I never saw her but once.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Extremely handsome; I have seen a face like
it too. Let us follow 'em.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife, Alithea</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy; Horner</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span> <i>following
them.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Come, Sparkish, your mistress saw you, and will
be angry you go not to her. Besides, I would fain be
reconciled to her, which none but you can do, dear
friend.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Well, that's a better reason, dear friend. I
would not go near her now for her's or my own sake;
but I can deny you nothing: for though I have known
thee a great while, never go, if I do not love thee as well
as a new acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I am obliged to you indeed, dear friend. I
would be well with her, only to be well with thee still;
for these ties to wives usually dissolve all ties to friends.
I would be contented she should enjoy you a-nights, but
I would have you to myself a-days as I have had, dear
friend.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> And thou shalt enjoy me a-days, dear, dear
friend, never stir: and I'll be divorced from her, sooner
than from thee. Come along.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, we are hard put to't, when we make
our rival our procurer; but neither she nor her brother
would let me come near her now. When all's done, a
rival is the best cloak to steal to a mistress under, without
suspicion; and when we have once got to her as we
desire, we throw him off like other cloaks.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish, Harcourt</span> <i>following him.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.] Sister, if you will not go, we
must leave you.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] The fool her gallant and she
will muster up all the young saunterers of this place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
they will leave their dear sempstresses to follow us. What
a swarm of cuckolds and cuckold-makers are here!&mdash;Come,
let's be gone, Mistress Margery.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Don't you believe that; I han't half my
bellyfull of sights yet.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Then walk this way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Lord, what a power of brave signs are
here! stay&mdash;the Bull's-Head, the Ram's-Head, and the
Stag's-Head, dear&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Nay, if every husband's proper sign here were
visible, they would be all alike.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What d'ye mean by that, bud?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis no matter&mdash;no matter, bud.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Pinch.</i> Pray tell me: nay, I will know.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> They would be all Bulls, Stags, and Rams-heads.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish, Harcourt, Alithea</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>,
<i>at the other side.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, dear madam, for my sake you shall be
reconciled to him.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> For your sake I hate him.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> That's something too cruel, madam, to hate me
for his sake.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay indeed, madam, too, too cruel to me, to
hate my friend for my sake.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I hate him because he is your enemy; and you
ought to hate him too, for making love to me, if you love
me.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> That's a good one! I hate a man for loving
you! If he did love you, 'tis but what he can't help;
and 'tis your fault, not his, if he admires you. I hate a
man for being of my opinion! I'll n'er do't, by the world.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Is it for your honour, or mine, to suffer a man
to make love to me, who am to marry you to-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Is it for your honour, or mine, to have me
jealous? That he makes love to you, is a sign you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
handsome; and that I am not jealous, is a sign you are
virtuous. That I think is for your honour.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> But 'tis your honour too I am concerned for.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But why, dearest madam, will you be more
concerned for his honour than he is himself? Let his
honour alone, for my sake and his. He! he has no
honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How's that?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But what my dear friend can guard himself.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> O ho&mdash;that's right again.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Your care of his honour argues his neglect of it,
which is no honour to my dear friend here. Therefore
once more, let his honour go which way it will, dear
madam.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay, ay; were it for my honour to marry a
woman whose virtue I suspected, and could not trust her
in a friend's hands?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Are you not afraid to lose me?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> He afraid to lose you, madam! No, no&mdash;you may
see how the most estimable and most glorious creature
in the world is valued by him. Will you not see it?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Right, honest Frank, I have that noble value
for her that I cannot be jealous of her.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> You mistake him. He means, you care not for
me, nor who has me.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Lord, madam, I see you are jealous! Will you
wrest a poor man's meaning from his words?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> You astonish me, sir, with your want of jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> And you make me giddy, madam, with your
jealousy and fears, and virtue and honour. 'Gad, I see
virtue makes a woman as troublesome as a little reading
or learning.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Monstrous!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well, to see what easy husbands these women of
quality can meet with! a poor chambermaid can never
have such ladylike luck. Besides, he's thrown away upon
her. She'll make no use of her fortune, her blessing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
none to a gentleman, for a pure cuckold; for it requires
good breeding to be a cuckold. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I tell you then plainly, he pursues me to marry
me.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Come, madam, you see you strive in vain to make
him jealous of me. My dear friend is the kindest creature
in the world to me.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Poor fellow!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> But his kindness only is not enough for me,
without your favour, your good opinion, dear madam:
'tis that must perfect my happiness. Good gentleman,
he believes all I say: would you would do so! Jealous
of me! I would not wrong him nor you for the world.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Look you there. Hear him, hear him, and do
not walk away so. [<span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>walks carelessly to and fro.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I love you, madam, so&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How's that? Nay, now you begin to go too far
indeed.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> So much, I confess, I say, I love you, that I would
not have you miserable, and cast yourself away upon so
unworthy and inconsiderable a thing as what you see here.
[<i>Clapping his hand on his breast, points at</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, faith, I believe thou wouldst not: now his
meaning is plain; but I knew before thou wouldst not
wrong me, nor her.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, no, Heavens forbid the glory of her sex
should fall so low, as into the embraces of such a contemptible
wretch, the least of mankind&mdash;my friend here&mdash;I
injure him! [<i>Embracing</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, no, dear friend, I knew it.&mdash;Madam, you
see he will rather wrong himself than me, in giving himself
such names.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Do not you understand him yet?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Yes: how modestly he speaks of himself, poor
fellow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Methinks he speaks impudently of yourself,
since&mdash;before yourself too; insomuch that I can no longer
suffer his scurrilous abusiveness to you, no more than his
love to me. [<i>Offers to go.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, nay, madam, pray stay&mdash;his love to you!
Lord, madam, has he not spoke yet plain enough?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Yes, indeed, I should think so.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Well then, by the world, a man can't speak
civilly to a woman now, but presently she says, he makes
love to her. Nay, madam, you shall stay, with your
pardon, since you have not yet understood him, till he
has made an eclaircissement of his love to you, that is,
what kind of love it is. Answer to thy catechism, friend;
do you love my mistress here?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Yes, I wish she would not doubt it.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But how do you love her?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> With all my soul.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I thank him, methinks he speaks plain enough
now.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.] You are out still.&mdash;But with what
kind of love, Harcourt?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> With the best and the truest love in the world.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Look you there then, that is with no matrimonial
love, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> How's that? do you say matrimonial love is not
best?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> 'Gad, I went too far ere I was aware. But speak
for thyself, Harcourt, you said you would not wrong me
nor her.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, so, madam, e'en take him for Heaven's sake.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Look you there, madam.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who should in all justice be yours, he that loves
you most. [<i>Claps his hand on his breast.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Look you there, Mr. Sparkish, who's that?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Who should it be?&mdash;Go on, Harcourt.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who loves you more than women titles, or
fortune fools. [<i>Points at</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Look you there, he means me still, for he
points at me.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who can only match your faith and constancy in
love.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who knows, if it be possible, how to value so
much beauty and virtue.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Whose love can no more be equalled in the world,
than that heavenly form of yours.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who could no more suffer a rival, than your
absence, and yet could no more suspect your virtue, than
his own constancy in his love to you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Who, in fine, loves you better than his eyes, that
first made him love you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay&mdash;Nay, madam, faith, you shan't go till&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Have a care, lest you make me stay too long.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But till he has saluted you; that I may be
assured you are friends, after his honest advice and
declaration. Come, pray, madam, be friends with him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> You must pardon me, sir, that I am not yet so
obedient to you.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, invite your wife to kiss men? Monstrous!
are you not ashamed? I will never forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Are you not ashamed, that I should have more
confidence in the chastity of your family than you have?
You must not teach me, I am a man of honour, sir, though
I am frank and free; I am frank, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Very frank, sir, to share your wife with your
friends.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> He is an humble, menial friend, such as reconciles
the differences of the marriage bed; you know man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and wife do not always agree; I design him for that use,
therefore would have him well with my wife.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> A menial friend!&mdash;you will get a great many
menial friends, by showing your wife as you do.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What then? It may be I have a pleasure in't,
as I have to show fine clothes at a play-house, the first day,
and count money before poor rogues.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> He that shows his wife or money, will be in
danger of having them borrowed sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> I love to be envied, and would not marry a wife
that I alone could love; loving alone is as dull as eating
alone. Is it not a frank age? and I am a frank person;
and to tell you the truth, it may be, I love to have rivals
in a wife, they make her seem to a man still but as a kept
mistress; and so good night, for I must to Whitehall.&mdash;Madam,
I hope you are now reconciled to my friend; and
so I wish you a good night, madam, and sleep if you
can: for to-morrow you know I must visit you early with
a canonical gentleman. Good night, dear Harcourt.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Madam, I hope you will not refuse my visit to-morrow,
if it should be earlier with a canonical gentleman
than Mr. Sparkish's.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> This gentlewoman is yet under my care, therefore
you must yet forbear your freedom with her, sir.
[<i>Coming between</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Must, sir?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes, sir, she is my sister.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> 'Tis well she is, sir&mdash;for I must be her servant,
sir.&mdash;Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come away, sister, we had been gone, if it had
not been for you, and so avoided these lewd rake-hells,
who seem to haunt us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> How now, Pinchwife!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Your servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What! I see a little time in the country makes
a man turn wild and unsociable, and only fit to converse
with his horses, dogs, and his herds.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I have business, sir, and must mind it; your
business is pleasure, therefore you and I must go different
ways.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, you may go on, but this pretty young
gentleman&mdash;[<i>Takes hold of Mrs.</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> The lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And the maid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Shall stay with us; for I suppose their business
is the same with ours, pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Sdeath, he knows her, she carries it so sillily!
yet if he does not, I should be more silly to discover it
first. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Pray, let us go, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> [<i>To</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] Had you not rather stay
with us?&mdash;Prithee, Pinchwife, who is this pretty young
gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> One to whom I'm a guardian.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I wish
I could keep her out of your hands.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Who is he? I never saw anything so pretty in
all my life.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Pshaw! do not look upon him so much, he's a
poor bashful youth, you'll put him out of countenance.&mdash;Come
away, brother. [<i>Offers to take her away.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> O, your brother!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes, my wife's brother.&mdash;Come, come, she'll
stay supper for us.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I thought so, for he is very like her I saw you
at the play with, whom I told you I was in love with.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O jeminy! is that he that was in
love with me? I am glad on't, I vow, for he's a curious
fine gentleman, and I love him already, too.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] Is this he, bud?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come away, come away. [<i>To his</i> Wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, what haste are you in? why won't you let
me talk with him?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Because you'll debauch him; he's yet young
and innocent, and I would not have him debauched for
anything in the world.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] How she gazes on him!
the devil!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Harcourt, Dorilant, look you here, this is the
likeness of that dowdy he told us of, his wife; did you
ever see a lovelier creature? The rogue has reason to be
jealous of his wife, since she is like him, for she would
make all that see her in love with her.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> And, as I remember now, she is as like him here
as can be.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> She is indeed very pretty, if she be like him.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Very pretty? a very pretty commendation!&mdash;she
is a glorious creature, beautiful beyond all things I
ever beheld.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So, so.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> More beautiful than a poet's first mistress of
imagination.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Or another man's last mistress of flesh and
blood.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, now you jeer, sir; pray don't jeer
me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, come.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] By Heavens, she'll
discover herself!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I speak of your sister, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Ay, but saying she was handsome, if like him,
made him blush.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I am upon a rack!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Methinks he is so handsome he should not be
a man.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O, there 'tis out! he has discovered
her! I am not able to suffer any longer.&mdash;[<i>To his</i> Wife.]
Come, come away, I say.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, by your leave, sir, he shall not go yet.&mdash;[<i>Aside
to them.</i>] Harcourt, Dorilant, let us torment this
jealous rogue a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har. Dor.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I'll show you.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, pray let him go, I cannot stay fooling
any longer; I tell you his sister stays supper for us.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Does she? Come then, we'll all go to sup with
he and thee.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, now I think on't, having stayed so long for
us, I warrant she's gone to bed.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I wish she and
I were well out of their hands.&mdash;[<i>To his</i> Wife.] Come,
I must rise early to-morrow, come.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well then, if she be gone to bed, I wish her and
you a good night. But pray, young gentleman, present
my humble service to her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Thank you heartily, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] 'Sdeath, she will discover herself yet in
spite of me&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] He is something more civil to
you, for your kindness to his sister, than I am, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Tell her, dear sweet little gentleman, for all your
brother there, that you have revived the love I had for
her at first sight in the playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But did you love her indeed, and indeed?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, so.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Away, I say.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, stay.&mdash;Yes, indeed, and indeed, pray
do you tell her so, and give her this kiss from me.
[<i>Kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O Heavens! what do I suffer? Now
'tis too plain he knows her, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And this, and this&mdash;[<i>Kisses her again.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What do you kiss me for? I am no
woman.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, there, 'tis out.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come, I
cannot, nor will stay any longer.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, they shall send your lady a kiss too. Here,
Harcourt, Dorilant, will you not? [<i>They kiss her.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How! do I suffer this? Was I not
accusing another just now for this rascally patience, in
permitting his wife to be kissed before his face? Ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
thousand ulcers gnaw away their lips.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come,
come.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Good night, dear little gentleman; madam,
good night: farewell, Pinchwife.&mdash;[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.] Did not I tell you I would raise his
jealous gall?
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Horner, Harcourt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorilant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So, they are gone at last; stay, let me see first
if the coach be at this door. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

I desired you, sweet sir?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Sweet sir, but what will you give me then?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Anything. Come away into the next walk.

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Stay, stay, hold&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Hold, madam, hold, let him present him&mdash;he'll
come presently; nay, I will never let you go till you
answer my question.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> For God's sake, sir, I must follow 'em.
[<span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <i>struggling with</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, I have something to present you with too,
you shan't follow them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Where?&mdash;how&mdash;what's become of?&mdash;gone!&mdash;whither?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He's only gone with the gentleman, who will
give him something, an't please your worship.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Something!&mdash;give him something, with a pox!&mdash;where
are they?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> In the next walk only, brother.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Only, only! where, where?
[<i>Exit and returns presently, then goes out again.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> What's the matter with him? why so much concerned?
But, dearest madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Pray let me go, sir; I have said and suffered
enough already.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Then you will not look upon, nor pity, my
sufferings?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> To look upon 'em, when I cannot help 'em,
were cruelty, not pity; therefore, I will never see you
more.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Let me then, madam, have my privilege of a
banished lover, complaining or railing, and giving you
but a farewell reason why, if you cannot condescend to
marry me, you should not take that wretch, my rival.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He only, not you, since my honour is engaged
so far to him, can give me a reason why I should not
marry him; but if he be true, and what I think him to
me, I must be so to him. Your servant, sir.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Have women only constancy when 'tis a vice,
and are, like Fortune, only true to fools?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Thou sha't not stir, thou robust creature; you
see I can deal with you, therefore you should stay the
rather, and be kind.

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Gone, gone, not to be found! quite gone! ten
thousand plagues go with 'em! Which way went they?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> But into t'other walk, brother.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Their business will be done presently sure, an't
please your worship; it can't be long in doing, I'm sure
on't.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Are they not there?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, you know where they are, you infamous
wretch, eternal shame of your family, which you do not
dishonour enough yourself you think, but you must help
her to do it too, thou legion of bawds!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Good brother&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> The fine gentleman has given me better

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Has he so?&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Out of breath and

<p><i>Horn.</i> I have only given your little brother an orange,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Pinch. [To</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] Thank you, sir.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] You
have only squeezed my orange, I suppose, and given it
me again; yet I must have a city patience.&mdash;[<i>To his</i>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> O, Master Horner, come, come, the ladies
stay for you; your mistress, my wife, wonders you make
not more haste to her.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I have stayed this half hour for you here, and
'tis your fault I am not now with your wife.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> But, pray, don't let her know so much; the
truth on't is, I was advancing a certain project to his
majesty about&mdash;I'll tell you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, let's go, and hear it at your house. Good
night, sweet little gentleman; one kiss more, you'll remember
me now, I hope. [<i>Kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What, Sir Jasper, will you separate friends? He
promised to sup with us, and if you take him to your
house, you'll be in danger of our company too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Alas! gentlemen, my house is not fit for
you; there are none but civil women there, which are not
for your turn. He, you know, can bear with the society
of civil women now, ha! ha! ha! besides, he's one of my
family&mdash;he's&mdash;he! he! he!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> What is he?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Faith, my eunuch, since you'll have it; he!
he! he! [<i>Exeunt</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I rather wish thou wert his or my cuckold.
Harcourt, what a good cuckold is lost there for want of a
man to make him one? Thee and I cannot have Horner's
privilege, who can make use of it.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Ay, to poor Horner 'tis like coming to an estate
at threescore, when a man can't be the better for't.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Presently, bud.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Come, let us go too.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.] Madam,
your servant.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.] Good night, strapper.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Madam, though you will not let me have a good
day or night, I wish you one; but dare not name the
other half of my wish.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Good night, sir, for ever.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> I don't know where to put this here, dear
bud, you shall eat it; nay, you shall have part of the fine
gentleman's good things, or treat, as you call it, when we
come home.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Indeed, I deserve it, since I furnished the best
part of it. [<i>Strikes away the orange.</i></p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pinchwife's</span> <i>House in the morning.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>dressed in new clothes, and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well&mdash;madam, now have I
dressed you, and set you out with so
many ornaments, and spent upon you
ounces of essence and pulvillio;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and
all this for no other purpose but as
people adorn and perfume a corpse
for a stinking second-hand grave: such, or as bad, I
think Master Sparkish's bed.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Hold your peace.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Nay, madam, I will ask you the reason why you
would banish poor Master Harcourt for ever from your
sight; how could you be so hard-hearted?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> 'Twas because I was not hard-hearted.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, no; 'twas stark love and kindness, I
warrant.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> It was so; I would see him no more because I
love him.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Hey day, a very pretty reason!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> You do not understand me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I wish you may yourself.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I was engaged to marry, you see, another man,
whom my justice will not suffer me to deceive or injure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Can there be a greater cheat or wrong done to
a man than to give him your person without your heart?
I should make a conscience of it.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I'll retrieve it for him after I am married a
while.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> The woman that marries to love better, will be
as much mistaken as the wencher that marries to live
better. No, madam, marrying to increase love is like
gaming to become rich; alas! you only lose what little
stock you had before.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I find by your rhetoric you have been bribed to
betray me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Only by his merit, that has bribed your heart,
you see, against your word and rigid honour. But what
a devil is this honour! 'tis sure a disease in the head,
like the megrim or falling-sickness, that always hurries
people away to do themselves mischief. Men lose their
lives by it; women, what's dearer to 'em, their love, the
life of life.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Come, pray talk you no more of honour, nor
Master Harcourt; I wish the other would come to secure
my fidelity to him and his right in me.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You will marry him then?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Certainly, I have given him already my word,
and will my hand too, to make it good, when he comes.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Well, I wish I may never stick pin more, if he
be not an arrant natural, to t'other fine gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I own he wants the wit of Harcourt, which I
will dispense withal for another want he has, which is
want of jealousy, which men of wit seldom want.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Lord, madam, what should you do with a fool
to your husband? You intend to be honest, don't you?
then that husbandly virtue, credulity, is thrown away
upon you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He only that could suspect my virtue should
have cause to do it; 'tis Sparkish's confidence in my truth
that obliges me to be so faithful to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You are not sure his opinion may last.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I am satisfied, 'tis impossible for him to be
jealous after the proofs I have had of him. Jealousy in
a husband&mdash;Heaven defend me from it! it begets a
thousand plagues to a poor woman, the loss of her
honour, her quiet, and her&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And her pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> What d'ye mean, impertinent?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Liberty is a great pleasure, madam.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I say, loss of her honour, her quiet, nay, her
life sometimes; and what's as bad almost, the loss of this
town; that is, she is sent into the country, which is the
last ill-usage of a husband to a wife, I think.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O, does the wind lie there?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Then of necessity, madam, you think a man must carry
his wife into the country, if he be wise. The country is
as terrible, I find, to our young English ladies, as a
monastery to those abroad; and on my virginity, I think
they would rather marry a London jailer, than a high
sheriff of a county, since neither can stir from his employment.
Formerly women of wit married fools for a great
estate, a fine seat, or the like; but now 'tis for a pretty
seat only in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, St. James's-Fields, or
the Pall-Mall.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, <i>dressed like a</i> Parson.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Madam, your humble servant, a happy day to
you, and to us all.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Amen.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Who have we here?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> My chaplain, faith&mdash;O madam, poor Harcourt
remembers his humble service to you; and, in obedience
to your last commands, refrains coming into your sight.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Is not that he?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, fy, no; but to show that he ne'er intended
to hinder our match, has sent his brother here to join our
hands. When I get me a wife, I must get her a chaplain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
according to the custom; that is his brother, and my
chaplain.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> His brother!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And your chaplain, to preach in your pulpit
then&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> His brother!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, I knew you would not believe it.&mdash;I told
you, sir, she would take you for your brother Frank.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Believe it!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> His brother! ha! ha! he! he has a trick left
still, it seems. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, my dearest, pray let us go to church
before the canonical hour is past.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> For shame, you are abused still.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> By the world, 'tis strange now you are so incredulous.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> 'Tis strange you are so credulous.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Dearest of my life, hear me. I tell you this is
Ned Harcourt of Cambridge, by the world; you see he
has a sneaking college look. 'Tis true he's something
like his brother Frank; and they differ from each other
no more than in their age, for they were twins.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Your servant, sir; I cannot be so deceived,
though you are. But come, let's hear, how do you know
what you affirm so confidently?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Why, I'll tell you all. Frank Harcourt coming
to me this morning to wish me joy, and present his service
to you, I asked him if he could help me to a parson.
Whereupon he told me, he had a brother in town who was
in orders; and he went straight away, and sent him, you
see there, to me.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Yes, Frank goes and puts on a black coat, then
tells you he is Ned; that's all you have for't.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! pshaw! I tell you, by the same token,
the midwife put her garter about Frank's neck, to know
'em asunder, they were so like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Frank tells you this too?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay, and Ned there too: nay, they are both in
a story.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> So, so; very foolish.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Lord, if you won't believe one, you had best
try him by your chambermaid there; for chambermaids
must needs know chaplains from other men, they are so
used to 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Let's see: nay, I'll be sworn he has the canonical
smirk, and the filthy clammy palm of a chaplain.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Well, most reverend doctor, pray let us make an
end of this fooling.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> With all my soul, divine heavenly creature, when
you please.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> He speaks like a chaplain indeed.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Why, was there not soul, divine, heavenly, in
what he said?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Once more, most impertinent black coat, cease
your persecution, and let us have a conclusion of this
ridiculous love.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I had forgot, I must suit my style to my coat, or
I wear it in vain. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I have no more patience left; let us make once
an end of this troublesome love, I say.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> So be it, seraphic lady, when your honour shall
think it meet and convenient so to do.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> 'Gad I'm sure none but a chaplain could speak
so, I think.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Let me tell you, sir, this dull trick will not serve
your turn; though you delay our marriage, you shall not
hinder it.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Far be it from me, munificent patroness, to delay
your marriage; I desire nothing more than to marry you
presently, which I might do, if you yourself would; for
my noble, good-natured, and thrice generous patron here
would not hinder it.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, poor man, not I, faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> And now, madam, let me tell you plainly nobody
else shall marry you; by Heavens! I'll die first, for I'm
sure I should die after it.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> How his love has made him forget his function,
as I have seen it in real parsons!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> That was spoken like a chaplain too? now you
understand him, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Poor man, he takes it heinously to be refused;
I can't blame him, 'tis putting an indignity upon him, not
to be suffered; but you'll pardon me, madam, it shan't
be; he shall marry us; come away, pray madam.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ha! ha! he! more ado! 'tis late.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Invincible stupidity! I tell you, he would marry
me as your rival, not as your chaplain.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, come, madam. [<i>Pulling her away.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I pray, madam, do not refuse this reverend divine
the honour and satisfaction of marrying you; for I dare
say, he has set his heart upon't, good doctor.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> What can you hope or design by this?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I could answer her, a reprieve for a day only,
often revokes a hasty doom. At worst, if she will not
take mercy on me, and let me marry her, I have at least
the lover's second pleasure, hindering my rival's enjoyment,
though but for a time. [<i>Aside</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, madam, 'tis e'en twelve o'clock, and my
mother charged me never to be married out of the canonical
hours. Come, come; Lord, here's such a deal of
modesty, I warrant, the first day.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes, an't please your worship, married women
show all their modesty the first day, because married men
show all their love the first day. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Bedchamber in</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>discovered.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, tell me, I say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Lord! han't I told it a hundred times
over?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I would try, if in the repetition of the
ungrateful tale, I could find her altering it in the least
circumstance; for if her story be false, she is so too.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Come, how was't, baggage?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Lord, what pleasure you take to hear it
sure!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, you take more in telling it I find; but
speak, how was't?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> He carried me up into the house next to
the Exchange.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So, and you two were only in the room!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, for he sent away a youth that was
there, for some dried fruit, and China oranges.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Did he so? Damn him for it&mdash;and for&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But presently came up the gentlewoman
of the house.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> O, 'twas well she did; but what did he do
whilst the fruit came?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> He kissed me a hundred times, and told
me he fancied he kissed my fine sister, meaning me, you
know, whom he said he loved with all his soul, and bid me
be sure to tell her so, and to desire her to be at her window,
by eleven of the clock this morning, and he would walk
under it at that time.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> And he was as good as his word, very punctual;
a pox reward him for't. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Well, and he said if you were not within,
he would come up to her, meaning me, you know, bud,
still.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So&mdash;he knew her certainly; but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
this confession, I am obliged to her simplicity.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
But what, you stood very still when he kissed you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, I warrant you; would you have had
me discovered myself?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But you told me he did some beastliness to you,
as you call it; what was't?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, he put&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, he put the tip of his tongue
between my lips, and so mousled me&mdash;and I said, I'd
bite it.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> An eternal canker seize it, for a dog!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, you need not be so angry with him
neither, for to say truth, he has the sweetest breath I
ever knew.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> The devil! you were satisfied with it then, and
would do it again?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Not unless he should force me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Force you, changeling! I tell you, no woman
can be forced.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, but she may sure, by such a one as
he, for he's a proper, goodly, strong man; 'tis hard, let
me tell you, to resist him.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, 'tis plain she loves him, yet she has
not love enough to make her conceal it from me; but the
sight of him will increase her aversion for me and love for
him; and that love instruct her how to deceive me and
satisfy him, all idiot as she is. Love! 'twas he gave
women first their craft, their art of deluding. Out of
Nature's hands they came plain, open, silly, and fit for
slaves, as she and Heaven intended 'em; but damned
Love&mdash;well&mdash;I must strangle that little monster whilst I
can deal with him.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Go fetch pen, ink, and
paper out of the next room.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, bud. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why should women have more invention in love
than men? It can only be, because they have more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
desires, more soliciting passions, more lust, and more of
the devil.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p>Come, minx, sit down and write.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Ay, dear bud, but I can't do't very
well.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I wish you could not at all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> But what should I write for?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I'll have you write a letter to your lover.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord, to the fine gentleman a letter!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes, to the fine gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Lord, you do but jeer: sure you jest.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I am not so merry: come, write as I bid
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What, do you think I am a fool?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] She's afraid I would not dictate any love
to him, therefore she's unwilling.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] But you had
best begin.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Indeed, and indeed, but I won't, so I
won't.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Because he's in town; you may send for
him if you will.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Very well, you would have him brought to you;
is it come to this? I say, take the pen and write, or you'll
provoke me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Lord, what d'ye make a fool of me for?
Don't I know that letters are never writ but from the
country to London, and from London into the country?
Now he's in town, and I am in town too; therefore I can't
write to him, you know.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, I am glad it is no worse; she is
innocent enough yet.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Yes, you may, when
your husband bids you, write letters to people that are
in town.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O, may I so? then I'm satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, begin:&mdash;"Sir"&mdash;[<i>Dictates.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Shan't I say, "Dear Sir?"&mdash;You know one
says always something more than bare "sir."</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Write as I bid you, or I will write whore with
this penknife in your face.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, good bud&mdash;"Sir"&mdash;[<i>Writes.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> "Though I suffered last night your nauseous,
loathed kisses and embraces"&mdash;Write!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch</i> Nay, why should I say so? You know I
told you he had a sweet breath.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Write!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Let me but put out "loathed."</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Write, I say!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Well then. [<i>Writes.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Let's see, what have you writ?&mdash;[<i>Takes the
paper and reads.</i>] "Though I suffered last night your
kisses and embraces"&mdash;Thou impudent creature! where
is "nauseous" and "loathed?"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> I can't abide to write such filthy words.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Once more write as I'd have you, and question
it not, or I will spoil thy writing with this. I will stab
out those eyes that cause my mischief.
[<i>Holds up the penknife.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord! I will.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> So&mdash;so&mdash;let's see now.&mdash;[<i>Reads.</i>] "Though I
suffered last night your nauseous, loathed kisses and
embraces"&mdash;go on&mdash;"yet I would not have you presume
that you shall ever repeat them"&mdash;so&mdash;[<i>She writes.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> I have writ it.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> On, then&mdash;"I then concealed myself from your
knowledge, to avoid your insolencies."&mdash;[<i>She writes.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> So&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> "The same reason, now I am out of your

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, do you sigh?&mdash;"detests you&mdash;as much
as she loves her husband and her honour&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> I vow, husband, he'll ne'er believe I
should write such a letter.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, he'd expect a kinder from you? Come,
now your name only.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What, shan't I say "Your most faithful
humble servant till death?"</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No, tormenting fiend!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Her style, I
find, would be very soft.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come, wrap it up
now whilst I go fetch wax and a candle; and write on
the backside, "For Mr. Horner." [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> "For Mr. Horner."&mdash;So, I am glad he
has told me his name. Dear Mr. Horner! but why
should I send thee such a letter that will vex thee, and

he won't let me love Mr. Horner&mdash;but what care I for

I think I have; there's my letter going to Mr. Horner,

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis very well; but I warrant, you would not
have it go now?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, indeed, but I would, bud, now.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, you are a good girl then. Come, let me
lock you up in your chamber, till I come back; and be
sure you come not within three strides of the window
when I am gone, for I have a spy in the street.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife, Pinchwife</span> <i>locks the door.</i>] At least, 'tis
fit she think so. If we do not cheat women, they'll
cheat us, and fraud may be justly used with secret
enemies, of which a wife is the most dangerous; and he
that has a handsome one to keep, and a frontier town,
must provide against treachery, rather than open force.
Now I have secured all within, I'll deal with the foe
without, with false intelligence.

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, good domine doctor, I deceive you, it
seems, and others too; for the grave matrons, and old,
rigid husbands think me as unfit for love, as they are;
but their wives, sisters, and daughters know, some of
'em, better things already.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Already!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Already, I say. Last night I was drunk with
half-a-dozen of your civil persons, as you call 'em, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
people of honour, and so was made free of their society
and dressing-rooms for ever hereafter; and am already
come to the privileges of sleeping upon their pallets,
warming smocks, tying shoes and garters, and the like,
doctor, already, already, doctor.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> You have made good use of your time, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I tell thee, I am now no more interruption to
'em, when they sing, or talk bawdy, than a little squab
French page who speaks no English.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> But do civil persons and women of honour
drink, and sing bawdy songs?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> O, amongst friends, amongst friends. For your
bigots in honour are just like those in religion; they fear
the eye of the world more than the eye of Heaven; and
think there is no virtue, but railing at vice, and no sin,
but giving scandal. They rail at a poor, little, kept
player, and keep themselves some young, modest pulpit
comedian to be privy to their sins in their closets, not
to tell 'em of them in their chapels.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Nay, the truth on't is, priests, amongst the
women now, have quite got the better of us lay-confessors,
physicians.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And they are rather their patients; but&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, <i>looking about her.</i></p>

<p>Now we talk of women of honour, here comes one. Step
behind the screen there, and but observe, if I have not
particular privileges with the women of reputation already,
doctor, already. [Quack <i>retires.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Well, Horner, am not I a woman of honour?
you see, I'm as good as my word.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And you shall see, madam, I'll not be behindhand
with you in honour; and I'll be as good as my
word too, if you please but to withdraw into the next
room.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But first, my dear sir, you must promise to
have a care of my dear honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> If you talk a word more of your honour,
you'll make me incapable to wrong it. To talk of
honour in the mysteries of love, is like talking of Heaven
or the Deity, in an operation of witchcraft, just when
you are employing the devil: it makes the charm
impotent.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Nay, fy! let us not be smutty. But you
talk of mysteries and bewitching to me; I don't understand
you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I tell you, madam, the word money in a
mistress's mouth, at such a nick of time, is not a more
disheartening sound to a younger brother, than that of
honour to an eager lover like myself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> But you can't blame a lady of my reputation
to be chary.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Chary! I have been chary of it already, by the
report I have caused of myself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Ay, but if you should ever let other women
know that dear secret, it would come out. Nay, you
must have a great care of your conduct; for my acquaintance
are so censorious, (oh, 'tis a wicked, censorious
world, Mr. Horner!) I say, are so censorious, and detracting,
that perhaps they'll talk to the prejudice of my
honour, though you should not let them know the dear
secret.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, madam, rather than they shall prejudice
your honour, I'll prejudice theirs; and, to serve
you, I'll lie with 'em all, make the secret their own,
and then they'll keep it. I am a Machiavel in love,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> O, no sir, not that way.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, the devil take me, if censorious women
are to be silenced any other way.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> A secret is better kept, I hope, by a single
person than a multitude; therefore pray do not trust any
body else with it, dear, dear Mr. Horner.

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> How now!</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O my husband!&mdash;prevented&mdash;and
what's almost as bad, found with my arms about another
man&mdash;that will appear too much&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Sir Jasper, come hither: I am trying if Mr.
Horner were ticklish, and he's as ticklish as can be. I
love to torment the confounded toad; let you and I
tickle him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No, your ladyship will tickle him better
without me, I suppose. But is this your buying china?
I thought you had been at the china-house.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] China-house! that's my cue, I must
take it.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] A pox! can't you keep your impertinent
wives at home? Some men are troubled with the
husbands, but I with the wives; but I'd have you to
know, since I cannot be your journeyman by night, I
will not be your drudge by day, to squire your wife about,
and be your man of straw, or scarecrow only to pies and
jays, that would be nibbling at your forbidden fruit; I
shall be shortly the hackney gentleman-usher of the town.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He! he! he! poor fellow, he's in
the right on't, faith. To squire women about for other
folks is as ungrateful an employment, as to tell money
for other folks.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] He! he! he! be'n't angry,
Horner.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> No, 'tis I have more reason to be angry,
who am left by you, to go abroad indecently alone; or,
what is more indecent, to pin myself upon such ill-bred
people of your acquaintance as this is.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Nay, prithee, what has he done?</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Nay, he has done nothing.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> But what d'ye take ill, if he has done
nothing?</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Ha! ha! ha! faith, I can't but laugh however;
why, d'ye think the unmannerly toad would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
down to me to the coach? I was fain to come up to
fetch him, or go without him, which I was resolved not
to do; for he knows china very well, and has himself
very good, but will not let me see it, lest I should beg
some; but I will find it out, and have what I came for
yet.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> [<i>Apart to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, <i>as he follows her to the
door.</i>] Lock the door, madam.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, <i>and
locks the door.</i>]&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] So, she has got into my
chamber and locked me out. Oh the impertinency of
woman-kind! Well, Sir Jasper, plain-dealing is a jewel;
if ever you suffer your wife to trouble me again here, she
shall carry you home a pair of horns; by my lord mayor
she shall; though I cannot furnish you myself, you are
sure, yet I'll find a way.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha! ha! he!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] At my first coming
in, and finding her arms about him, tickling him it seems,
I was half jealous, but now I see my folly.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
He! he! he! poor Horner.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, though you laugh now, 'twill be my turn
ere long. Oh women, more impertinent, more cunning,
and more mischievous than their monkeys, and to me
almost as ugly!&mdash;Now is she throwing my things about
and rifling all I have; but I'll get into her the back way,
and so rifle her for it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ha! ha! ha! poor angry Horner.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Stay here a little, I'll ferret her out to you
presently, I warrant. <i>Exit at the other door.</i>
[Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> <i>talks through the door to his</i> Wife,

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Wife! my Lady Fidget! wife! he is coming
in to you the back way.</p>

<p><i>Lady Fid.</i> Let him come, and welcome, which way he
will.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He'll catch you, and use you roughly, and
be too strong for you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Where's this woman-hater, this toad,
this ugly, greasy, dirty sloven?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, the women all will have him
ugly; methinks he is a comely person, but his wants
make his form contemptible to 'em; and 'tis e'en as my
wife said yesterday, talking of him, that a proper handsome
eunuch was as ridiculous a thing as a gigantic
coward.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Sir Jasper, your servant: where is the
odious beast?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He's within in his chamber, with my wife;
she's playing the wag with him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Is she so? and he's a clownish beast,
he'll give her no quarter, he'll play the wag with her
again, let me tell you: come, let's go help her&mdash;What,
the door's locked?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Ay, my wife locked it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Did she so? let's break it open then.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No, no, he'll do her no hurt.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> Ay, but where is she then? where is she?
Lord, Sir Jasper, I have e'en rattled myself to pieces in

they say below, no woman lodges here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> No! what does she here then? say, if it
be not a woman's lodging, what makes she here? But
are you sure no woman lodges here?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No, nor no man neither, this is Mr. Horner's

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> Is it so, are you sure?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> So; then there's no hurt in't, I hope. But
where is he?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He's in the next room with my wife.</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> Nay, if you trust him with your wife, I
may with my Biddy. They say, he's a merry harmless
man now, e'en as harmless a man as ever came out of
Italy with a good voice, and as pretty, harmless company
for a lady, as a snake without his teeth.</p>

Good Mr. Horner, don't think to give other people china,

he has no more left.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> O, but it may be he may have some you
could not find.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> What, d'ye think if he had had any left, I
would not have had it too? for we women of quality
never think we have china enough.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Do not take it ill, I cannot make china for
you all, but I will have a roll-waggon for you too, another
time.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No faith, not I, how could I?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Yes, yes, I'm sure you did. A man so well

my squirrel."&mdash;It seems he knows not what the letter
contains.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, ne'er wonder at it so much.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Faith, I can't help it.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Now, I think I have deserved your infinite
friendship and kindness, and have showed myself
sufficiently an obliging kind friend and husband; am I
not so, to bring a letter from my wife to her gallant?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, the devil take me, art thou, the most
obliging, kind friend and husband in the world, ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, you may be merry, sir; but in short I
must tell you, sir, my honour will suffer no jesting.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What dost thou mean?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Does the letter want a comment? Then, know,
sir, though I have been so civil a husband, as to bring
you a letter from my wife, to let you kiss and court her
to my face, I will not be a cuckold, sir, I will not.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Thou art mad with jealousy. I never saw thy
wife in my life but at the play yesterday, and I know not
if it were she or no. I court her, kiss her!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I will not be a cuckold, I say; there will be
danger in making me a cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, wert thou not well cured of thy last clap?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I wear a sword.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> It should be taken from thee, lest thou shouldst
do thyself a mischief with it; thou art mad, man.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> As mad as I am, and as merry as you are,
I must have more reason from you ere we part. I
say again, though you kissed and courted last night my
wife in man's clothes, as she confesses in her letter&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ha! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Both she and I say, you must not design it
again, for you have mistaken your woman, as you have

Was that thy wife! Why wouldst thou not tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
me 'twas she? Faith, my freedom with her was your
fault, not mine.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Faith, so 'twas. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Fy! I'd never do't to a woman before her
husband's face, sure.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But I had rather you should do't to my wife
before my face, than behind my back; and that you shall
never do.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No&mdash;you will hinder me.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> If I would not hinder you, you see by her letter
she would.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, I must e'en acquiesce then, and be contented
with what she writes.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I'll assure you 'twas voluntarily writ; I had no
hand in't you may believe me.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I do believe thee, faith.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> And believe her too, for she's an innocent
creature, has no dissembling in her: and so fare you
well, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Pray, however, present my humble service to
her, and tell her, I will obey her letter to a tittle, and
fulfil her desires, be what they will, or with what difficulty
soever I do't; and you shall be no more jealous of me, I
warrant her, and you.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well then, fare you well; and play with any
man's honour but mine, kiss any man's wife but mine, and
welcome. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

say'st thou to't? 'tis an original.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> So are your cuckolds too originals: for they
are like no other common cuckolds, and I will henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
believe it not impossible for you to cuckold the Grand
Signior amidst his guards of eunuchs, that I say.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And I say for the letter, 'tis the first love-letter
that ever was without flames, darts, fates, destinies, lying
and dissembling in't.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come back, you are a pretty brother-in-law,
neither go to church nor to dinner with your sister bride!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> My sister denies her marriage, and you see is
gone away from you dissatisfied.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! upon a foolish scruple, that our parson
was not in lawful orders, and did not say all the common-prayer;
but 'tis her modesty only I believe. But let all
women be never so modest the first day, they'll be sure to
come to themselves by night, and I shall have enough of
her then. In the mean time, Harry Horner, you must
dine with me: I keep my wedding at my aunt's in the
Piazza.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Thy wedding! what stale maid has lived to
despair of a husband, or what young one of a gallant?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> O, your servant, sir&mdash;this gentleman's sister
then,&mdash;no stale maid.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I'm sorry for't.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How comes he so concerned for her? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> You sorry for't? why, do you know any ill by
her?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, I know none but by thee; 'tis for her sake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
not yours, and another man's sake that might have hoped,
I thought.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Another man! another man! what is his
name?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, since 'tis past, he shall be nameless.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
Poor Harcourt! I am sorry thou hast missed her.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> He seems to be much troubled at the match.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Prithee, tell me&mdash;Nay, you shan't go, brother.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I must of necessity, but I'll come to you to
dinner. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But, Harry, what, have I a rival in my wife
already? But with all my heart, for he may be of use to
me hereafter; for though my hunger is now my sauce,
and I can fall on heartily without, the time will come,
when a rival will be as good sauce for a married man to a
wife, as an orange to veal.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> O thou damned rogue! thou hast set my teeth
on edge with thy orange.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Then let's to dinner&mdash;there I was with you
again. Come.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But who dines with thee?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> My friends and relations, my brother Pinchwife,
you see, of your acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And his wife?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, 'gad, he'll ne'er let her come amongst us
good fellows; your stingy country coxcomb keeps his
wife from his friends, as he does his little firkin of ale, for
his own drinking, and a gentleman can't get a smack
on't; but his servants, when his back is turned, broach it
at their pleasures, and dust it away, ha! ha! ha!&mdash;'Gad,
I am witty, I think, considering I was married to-day, by
the world; but come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, I will not dine with you, unless you can
fetch her too.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Pshaw! what pleasure canst thou have with
women now, Harry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> My eyes are not gone; I love a good prospect
yet, and will not dine with you unless she does too; go
fetch her, therefore, but do not tell her husband 'tis for
my sake.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Well, I'll go try what I can do; in the meantime,
come away to my aunt's lodging, 'tis in the way to
Pinchwife's.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> The poor woman has called for aid, and
stretched forth her hand, doctor; I cannot but help her
over the pale out of the briars. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p class="center">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>alone, leaning on her elbow.&mdash;A table,
pen, ink and paper.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Well, 'tis e'en so, I have got the London
disease they call love; I am sick of my husband, and for
my gallant. I have heard this distemper called a fever,
but methinks 'tis like an ague; for when I think of my
husband, I tremble, and am in a cold sweat, and have
inclinations to vomit; but when I think of my gallant,
dear Mr. Horner, my hot fit comes, and I am all in a
fever indeed; and, as in other fevers, my own chamber
is tedious to me, and I would fain be removed to his, and
then methinks I should be well. Ah, poor Mr. Horner!
Well, I cannot, will not stay here; therefore I'll make an
end of my letter to him, which shall be a finer letter than
my last, because I have studied it like anything. Oh
sick, sick! [<i>Takes the pen and writes.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>, <i>who seeing her writing, steals softly
behind her and looking over her shoulder, snatches the
paper from her.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, writing more letters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord, bud, why d'ye fright me so?
[<i>She offers to run out; he stops her, and reads.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How's this? nay, you shall not stir, madam:&mdash;"Dear,
dear, dear Mr. Horner"&mdash;very well&mdash;I have
taught you to write letters to good purpose&mdash;but let us
see't. "First, I am to beg your pardon for my boldness in
writing to you, which I'd have you to know I would not
have done, had not you said first you loved me so
extremely, which if you do, you will never suffer me to
lie in the arms of another man whom I loathe, nauseate,
and detest."&mdash;Now you can write these filthy words.
But what follows?&mdash;"Therefore, I hope you will speedily
find some way to free me from this unfortunate match,
which was never, I assure you, of my choice, but I'm
afraid 'tis already too far gone; however, if you love me,
as I do you, you will try what you can do; but you
must help me away before to-morrow, or else, alas! I
shall be for ever out of your reach, for I can defer no
longer our&mdash;our&mdash;" what is to follow "our"?&mdash;speak,
what&mdash;our journey into the country I suppose&mdash;Oh
woman, damned woman! and Love, damned Love, their
old tempter! for this is one of his miracles; in a moment
he can make those blind that could see, and those see
that were blind, those dumb that could speak, and those
prattle who were dumb before; nay, what is more than
all, make these dough-baked, senseless, indocile animals,
women, too hard for us their politic lords and rulers, in a
moment. But make an end of your letter, and then I'll
make an end of you thus, and all my plagues together.
[<i>Draws his sword.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord, O Lord, you are such a passionate
man, bud!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> How now, what's here to do?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> This fool here now!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What! drawn upon your wife? You should
never do that, but at night in the dark, when you can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
hurt her. This is my sister-in-law, is it not? ay, faith, e'en
our country Margery; [<i>Pulls aside her handkerchief</i>] one
may know her. Come, she and you must go dine with
me; dinner's ready, come. But where's my wife? is she
not come home yet? where is she?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Making you a cuckold; 'tis that they all do, as
soon as they can.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What, the wedding-day? no, a wife that designs
to make a cully of her husband will be sure to let him
win the first stake of love, by the world. But come, they
stay dinner for us: come, I'll lead down our Margery.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No&mdash;sir, go, we'll follow you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> I will not wag without you.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> This coxcomb is a sensible torment to me
amidst the greatest in the world. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, come, Madam Margery.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No; I'll lead her my way: what, would you
treat your friends with mine, for want of your own wife?&mdash;[<i>Leads
her to the other door, and locks her in and returns.</i>]
I am contented my rage should take breath&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> I told Horner this.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come now.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Lord, how shy you are of your wife! but let
me tell you, brother, we men of wit have amongst us a
saying, that cuckolding, like the small-pox, comes with a
fear; and you may keep your wife as much as you will out
of danger of infection, but if her constitution incline her
to't, she'll have it sooner or later, by the world, say they.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What a thing is a cuckold, that every
fool can make him ridiculous!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Well, sir&mdash;but
let me advise you, now you are come to be concerned,
because you suspect the danger, not to neglect the means
to prevent it, especially when the greatest share of the
malady will light upon your own head, for</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pinchwife's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>. <i>A table
and candle.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, take the pen and make
an end of the letter, just as you intended;
if you are false in a tittle, I
shall soon perceive it, and punish you
as you deserve.&mdash;[<i>Lays his hand on his
sword.</i>] Write what was to follow&mdash;let's
see&mdash;"You must make haste, and help me away before
to-morrow, or else I shall be for ever out of your reach,
for I can defer no longer our"&mdash;What follows "our"?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Must all out, then, bud?&mdash;Look you
there, then. [Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>takes the pen and writes.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Let's see&mdash;"For I can defer no longer
our&mdash;wedding&mdash;Your slighted Alithea."&mdash;What's the meaning
of this? my sister's name to't? speak, unriddle.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, indeed, bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But why her name to't? speak&mdash;speak, I say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Ay, but you'll tell her then again. If you
would not tell her again&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I will not:&mdash;I am stunned, my head turns
round.&mdash;Speak.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Won't you tell her, indeed, and indeed?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> No; speak, I say.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> She'll be angry with me; but I had
rather she should be angry with me than you, bud;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
and, to tell you the truth, 'twas she made me write the
letter, and taught me what I should write.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ha!&mdash;I thought the style was somewhat
better than her own.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Could she come
to you to teach you, since I had locked you up alone?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O, through the key-hole, bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But why should she make you write a letter for
her to him, since she can write herself?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, she said because&mdash;for I was unwilling
to do it&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Because what&mdash;because?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Because, lest Mr. Horner should be
cruel, and refuse her; or be vain afterwards, and show
the letter, she might disown it, the hand not being
hers.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] How's this? Ha!&mdash;then I think I shall
come to myself again.&mdash;This changeling could not invent
this lie: but if she could, why should she? she might
think I should soon discover it.&mdash;Stay&mdash;now I think on't
too, Horner said he was sorry she had married Sparkish;
and her disowning her marriage to me makes me think
she has evaded it for Horner's sake: yet why should she
take this course? But men in love are fools; women
may well be so&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] But hark you, madam, your
sister went out in the morning, and I have not seen her
within since.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Alack-a-day, she has been crying all day
above, it seems, in a corner.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Where is she? let me speak with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O Lord, then she'll discover
all!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Pray hold, bud; what, d'ye mean to discover
me? she'll know I have told you then. Pray, bud,
let me talk with her first.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I must speak with her, to know whether Horner
ever made her any promise, and whether she be married
to Sparkish or no.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray, dear bud, don't, till I have spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
with her, and told her that I have told you all; for she'll
kill me else.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Go then, and bid her come out to me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Yes, yes, bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Let me see&mdash;[<i>Pausing.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll go, but she is not within to
come to him: I have just got time to know of Lucy her
maid, who first set me on work, what lie I shall tell next;
for I am e'en at my wit's end. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Well, I resolve it, Horner shall have her: I'd
rather give him my sister than lend him my wife; and
such an alliance will prevent his pretensions to my wife,
sure. I'll make him of kin to her, and then he won't care
for her.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord, bud! I told you what anger you
would make me with my sister.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Won't she come hither?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> No, no. Lack-a-day, she's ashamed to
look you in the face: and she says, if you go in to her,
she'll run away down stairs, and shamefully go herself to
Mr. Horner, who has promised her marriage, she says;
and she will have no other, so she won't.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Did he so?&mdash;promise her marriage!&mdash;then she
shall have no other. Go tell her so; and if she will come
and discourse with me a little concerning the means, I will
about it immediately. Go.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] His
estate is equal to Sparkish's, and his extraction as much
better than his, as his parts are; but my chief reason is,
I'd rather be akin to him by the name of brother-in-law
than that of cuckold.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p>Well, what says she now?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Why, she says, she would only have you
lead her to Horner's lodging; with whom she first will
discourse the matter before she talks with you, which yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
she cannot do; for alack, poor creature, she says she
can't so much as look you in the face, therefore she'll
come to you in a mask. And you must excuse her, if
she make you no answer to any question of yours, till you
have brought her to Mr. Horner; and if you will not
chide her, nor question her, she'll come out to you
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Let her come: I will not speak a word to her,
nor require a word from her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Oh, I forgot: besides she says, she cannot
look you in the face, though through a mask; therefore
would desire you to put out the candle.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I agree to all. Let her make haste.&mdash;There,
'tis out&mdash;[<i>Puts out the candle. Exit</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] My
case is something better: I'd rather fight with Horner for
not lying with my sister, than for lying with my wife; and
of the two, I had rather find my sister too forward than
my wife. I expected no other from her free education, as
she calls it, and her passion for the town. Well, wife and
sister are names which make us expect love and duty,
pleasure and comfort; but we find 'em plagues and
torments, and are equally, though differently, troublesome
to their keeper; for we have as much ado to get people
to lie with our sisters as to keep 'em from lying with our
wives.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>masked, and in hoods and scarfs,
and a night-gown and petticoat of</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea's</span>.</p>

<p>What, are you come, sister? let us go then.&mdash;But first, let
me lock up my wife. Mrs. Margery, where are you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Here, bud.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come hither, that I may lock you up: get you
in.&mdash;[<i>Locks the door.</i>] Come, sister, where are you now?
[Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>gives him her hand; but when
he lets her go, she steals softly on to the other
side of him, and is led away by him for his</i>
Sister, <span class="smcap">Alithea</span>.</p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horner's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Horner</span> <i>and</i> Quack.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> What, all alone? not so much as one of your
cuckolds here, nor one of their wives! They use to take
their turns with you, as if they were to watch you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes, it often happens that a cuckold is but his
wife's spy, and is more upon family duty when he is with
her gallant abroad, hindering his pleasure, than when he
is at home with her playing the gallant. But the hardest
duty a married woman imposes upon a lover is keeping
her husband company always.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> And his fondness wearies you almost as soon as
hers.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox! keeping a cuckold company, after you
have had his wife, is as tiresome as the company of a
country squire to a witty fellow of the town, when he has
got all his money.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> And as at first a man makes a friend of the
husband to get the wife, so at last you are fain to fall out
with the wife to be rid of the husband.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, most cuckold-makers are true courtiers;
when once a poor man has cracked his credit for 'em,
they can't abide to come near him.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> But at first, to draw him in, are so sweet, so
kind, so dear! just as you are to Pinchwife. But what
becomes of that intrigue with his wife?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox! he's as surly as an alderman that has
been bit; and since he's so coy, his wife's kindness is in
vain, for she's a silly innocent.</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Did she not send you a letter by him?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Yes; but that's a riddle I have not yet solved.
Allow the poor creature to be willing, she is silly too, and
he keeps her up so close&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Yes, so close, that he makes her but the more
willing, and adds but revenge to her love; which two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
when met, seldom fail of satisfying each other one way or
other.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What! here's the man we are talking of, I think.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>, <i>leading in his</i> Wife <i>masked, muffled,
and in her</i> Sister's <i>gown.</i></p>

<p>Pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Bringing his wife to you is the next thing to
bringing a love-letter from her.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What means this?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> The last time, you know, sir, I brought you a
love-letter; now, you see, a mistress; I think you'll say I
am a civil man to you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, the devil take me, will I say thou art the
civilest man I ever met with; and I have known some.
I fancy I understand thee now better than I did the letter.
But, hark thee, in thy ear&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nothing but the usual question, man: is she
sound, on thy word?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, you take her for a wench, and me for a
pimp?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Pshaw! wench and pimp, paw<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> words; I know
thou art an honest fellow, and hast a great acquaintance
among the ladies, and perhaps hast made love for me,
rather than let me make love to thy wife.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, sir, in short, I am for no fooling.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nor I neither: therefore prithee, let's see her
face presently. Make her show, man: art thou sure I
don't know her?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I am sure you do know her.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox! why dost thou bring her to me then?</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Because she's a relation of mine&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Is she, faith, man? then thou art still more civil
and obliging, dear rogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Who desired me to bring her to you.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Then she is obliging, dear rogue.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> You'll make her welcome for my sake, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I hope she is handsome enough to make herself
welcome. Prithee let her unmask.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Do you speak to her; she would never be ruled
by me.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Madam&mdash;[Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span> <i>whispers to</i>
<span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] She says she must speak with me in private.
Withdraw, prithee.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] She's unwilling, it seems, I should
know all her indecent conduct in this business&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Well then, I'll leave you together, and hope when I am
gone, you'll agree; if not, you and I shan't agree, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> What means the fool? if she and I agree 'tis no
matter what you and I do.
[<i>Whispers to</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>, <i>who makes signs
with her hand for him to be gone.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> In the mean time I'll fetch a parson, and find
out Sparkish, and disabuse him. You would have me
fetch a parson, would you not? Well then&mdash;now I think
I am rid of her, and shall have no more trouble with
her&mdash;our sisters and daughters, like usurers' money, are
safest when put out; but our wives, like their writings,
never safe, but in our closets under lock and key. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Sir Jasper Fidget, sir, is coming up. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Here's the trouble of a cuckold now we are
talking of. A pox on him! has he not enough to do to
hinder his wife's sport, but he must other women's too?&mdash;Step
in here, madam. [<i>Exit</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

Well, be short, for I am busy. What would
your impertinent wife have now?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Well guessed, i'faith; for I do come from her.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> To invite me to supper! Tell her, I can't come;
go.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Nay, now you are out, faith; for my lady,
and the whole knot of the virtuous gang, as they call
themselves, are resolved upon a frolic of coming to you
to-night in masquerade, and are all dressed already.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I shan't be at home.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Lord, how churlish he is to women!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Nay, prithee don't disappoint 'em; they'll
think 'tis my fault: prithee don't. I'll send in the
banquet and the fiddles. But make no noise on't; for
the poor virtuous rogues would not have it known, for the
world, that they go a-masquerading; and they would
come to no man's ball but yours.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well, well&mdash;get you gone; and tell 'em, if they
come, 'twill be at the peril of their honour and yours.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> He! he! he!&mdash;we'll trust you for that: farewell.

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>The Piazza of Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sparkish</span> <i>with a letter in his hand,</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>
<i>following.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> But who would have thought a woman could
have been false to me? By the world, I could not have
thought it.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> You were for giving and taking liberty: she has
taken it only, sir, now you find in that letter. You are a
frank person, and so is she, you see there.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, if this be her hand&mdash;for I never saw it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> 'Tis no matter whether that be her hand or no;
I am sure this hand, at her desire, led her to Mr. Horner,
with whom I left her just now, to go fetch a parson to 'em
at their desire too, to deprive you of her for ever; for it
seems yours was but a mock marriage.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Indeed, she would needs have it that 'twas
Harcourt himself, in a parson's habit, that married us;
but I'm sure he told me 'twas his brother Ned.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> O, there 'tis out; and you were deceived, not
she: for you are such a frank person. But I must be
gone.&mdash;You'll find her at Mr. Horner's. Go, and believe
your eyes. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, I'll to her, and call her as many crocodiles,
sirens, harpies, and other heathenish names, as a poet
would do a mistress who had refused to hear his
suit, nay more, his verses on her.&mdash;But stay, is not
that she following a torch at t'other end of the Piazza?
and from Horner's certainly&mdash;'tis so.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alithea</span> <i>following a torch, and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>behind.</i></p>

<p>You are well met, madam, though you don't think
so. What, you have made a short visit to Mr. Horner?
but I suppose you'll return to him presently, by that time
the parson can be with him.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Mr. Horner and the parson, sir!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Come, madam, no more dissembling, no more
jilting; for I am no more a frank person.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> How's this?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> So, 'twill work, I see. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Could you find out no easy country fool to
abuse? none but me, a gentleman of wit and pleasure
about the town? But it was your pride to be too hard
for a man of parts, unworthy false woman! false as a
friend that lends a man money to lose; false as dice, who
undo those that trust all they have to 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He has been a great bubble, by his similes, as
they say. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> You have been too merry, sir, at your wedding-dinner,
sure.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> What, d'ye mock me too?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Or you have been deluded.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> By you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Let me understand you.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Have you the confidence, (I should call it
something else, since you know your guilt,) to stand my
just reproaches? you did not write an impudent letter to
Mr. Horner? who I find now has clubbed with you in
deluding me with his aversion for women, that I might
not, forsooth, suspect him for my rival.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> D'ye think the gentleman can be jealous now,
madam? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> I write a letter to Mr. Horner!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Nay, madam, do not deny it. Your brother
showed it me just now; and told me likewise, he left
you at Horner's lodging to fetch a parson to marry you
to him; and I wish you joy, madam, joy, joy; and to him
too, much joy; and to myself more joy, for not marrying
you.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, I find my brother would break off
the match; and I can consent to't, since I see this gentleman
can be made jealous.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] O Lucy, by his
rude usage and jealousy, he makes me almost afraid I
am married to him. Art thou sure 'twas Harcourt himself,
and no parson, that married us?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> No, madam, I thank you. I suppose, that was
a contrivance too of Mr. Horner's and yours, to make
Harcourt play the parson; but I would as little as you
have him one now, no, not for the world. For, shall I
tell you another truth? I never had any passion for you
till now, for now I hate you. 'Tis true, I might have
married your portion, as other men of parts of the town
do sometimes; and so, your servant. And to show my
unconcernedness, I'll come to your wedding, and resign
you with as much joy, as I would a stale wench to a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
cully; nay, with as much joy as I would after the first
night, if I had been married to you. There's for you;
and so your servant, servant. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> How was I deceived in a man!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You'll believe then a fool may be made jealous
now? for that easiness in him that suffers him to be led
by a wife, will likewise permit him to be persuaded
against her by others.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> But marry Mr. Horner! my brother does not
intend it, sure: if I thought he did, I would take thy
advice, and Mr. Harcourt for my husband. And now I
wish, that if there be any over-wise woman of the town,
who, like me, would marry a fool for fortune, liberty, or
title, first, that her husband may love play, and be a cully
to all the town but her, and suffer none but Fortune to
be mistress of his purse; then, if for liberty, that he may
send her into the country, under the conduct of some
huswifely mother-in-law; and if for title, may the world
give 'em none but that of cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And for her greater curse, madam, may he not
deserve it.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Away, impertinent! Is not this my old Lady
Lanterlu's?<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes, madam.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] And here I hope we
shall find Mr. Harcourt. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horner's</span> <i>Lodging. A table, banquet,
and bottles.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dainty Fidget</span>,
<i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Squeamish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> A pox! they are come too soon&mdash;before I have
sent back my new mistress. All that I have now to do
is to lock her in, that they may not see her. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> That we may be sure of our welcome, we have
brought our entertainment with us, and are resolved to
treat thee, dear toad.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> And that we may be merry to purpose, have
left Sir Jasper and my old Lady Squeamish, quarrelling
at home at backgammon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Therefore let us make use of our time,
lest they should chance to interrupt us.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Let us sit then.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> First, that you may be private, let me lock this
door and that, and I'll wait upon you presently.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> No, sir, shut 'em only, and your lips for ever;
for we must trust you as much as our women.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> You know all vanity's killed in me; I have no
occasion for talking.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Now, ladies, supposing we had drank each of
us our two bottles, let us speak the truth of our hearts.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain. and Mrs. Squeam.</i> Agreed.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> By this brimmer, for truth is nowhere else to be
found&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] not in thy heart, false man!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> You have found me a true man, I'm sure.
[<i>Aside to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Fidget</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] Not every way.&mdash;But let
us sit and be merry. [<i>Sings.</i></p>

</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fain.</i> Dear brimmer! Well, in token of our
openness and plain-dealing, let us throw our masks over
our heads.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, 'twill come to the glasses anon. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Lovely brimmer! let me enjoy him first.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> No, I never part with a gallant till I've tried
him. Dear brimmer! that makest our husbands short-sighted.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> And our bashful gallants bold.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And, for want of a gallant, the butler
lovely in our eyes.&mdash;Drink, eunuch.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Drink, thou representative of a husband.&mdash;Damn
a husband!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> And, as it were a husband, an old keeper.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And an old grandmother.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And an English bawd, and a French surgeon.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Ay, we have all reason to curse 'em.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> For my sake, ladies?</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> No, for our own; for the first spoils all young
gallants' industry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> And the other's art makes 'em bold only
with common women.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And rather run the hazard of the vile
distemper amongst them, than of a denial amongst us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> The filthy toads choose mistresses now as
they do stuffs, for having been fancied and worn by
others.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> For being common and cheap.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Whilst women of quality, like the richest
stuffs, lie untumbled, and unasked for.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, neat, and cheap, and new, often they think
best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> No, sir, the beasts will be known by a
mistress longer than by a suit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And 'tis not for cheapness neither.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> No; for the vain fops will take up druggets,
and embroider 'em. But I wonder at the depraved
appetites of witty men; they use to be out of the common
road, and hate imitation. Pray tell me, beast, when you
were a man, why you rather chose to club with a multitude
in a common house for an entertainment, than to be
the only guest at a good table.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, faith, ceremony and expectation are unsufferable
to those that are sharp bent. People always eat
with the best stomach at an ordinary, where every man is
snatching for the best bit.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Though he get a cut over the fingers.&mdash;But I
have heard, that people eat most heartily of another man's
meat, that is, what they do not pay for.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> When they are sure of their welcome and freedom;
for ceremony in love and eating is as ridiculous as
in fighting: falling on briskly is all should be done on
those occasions.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Well then, let me tell you, sir, there is nowhere
more freedom than in our houses; and we take
freedom from a young person as a sign of good breeding;
and a person may be as free as he pleases with us,
as frolic, as gamesome, as wild as he will.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Han't I heard you all declaim against wild
men?</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Yes; but for all that, we think wildness in a
man as desirable a quality as in a duck or rabbit: a tame
man! foh!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I know not, but your reputations frightened me
as much as your faces invited me.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Our reputation! Lord, why should you not
think that we women make use of our reputation, as you
men of yours, only to deceive the world with less suspicion?
Our virtue is like the statesman's religion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
quaker's word, the gamester's oath, and the great man's
honour; but to cheat those that trust us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And that demureness, coyness, and
modesty, that you see in our faces in the boxes at plays,
is as much a sign of a kind woman, as a vizard-mask in
the pit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> For, I assure you, women are least masked
when they have the velvet vizard on.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> You would have found us modest women in
our denials only.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Our bashfulness is only the reflection of
the men's.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> We blush when they are shamefaced.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I beg your pardon, ladies, I was deceived in
you devilishly. But why that mighty pretence to
honour?</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> We have told you; but sometimes 'twas for
the same reason you men pretend business often, to avoid
ill company, to enjoy the better and more privately those
you love.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> But why would you ne'er give a friend a wink
then?</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Faith, your reputation frightened us, as much
as ours did you, you were so notoriously lewd.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And you so seemingly honest.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Was that all that deterred you?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And so expensive&mdash;you allow freedom, you say.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> That I was afraid of losing my little money, as
well as my little time, both which my other pleasures
required.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Money! foh! you talk like a little fellow
now: do such as we expect money?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I beg your pardon, madam, I must confess, I
have heard that great ladies, like great merchants, set but
the higher prices upon what they have, because they are
not in necessity of taking the first offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Such as we make sale of our hearts?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> We bribed for our love? foh!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> With your pardon ladies, I know, like great
men in offices, you seem to exact flattery and attendance
only from your followers; but you have receivers about
you, and such fees to pay, a man is afraid to pass your
grants. Besides, we must let you win at cards, or we
lose your hearts; and if you make an assignation, 'tis at
a goldsmith's, jeweller's, or china-house; where for your
honour you deposit to him, he must pawn his to the
punctual cit, and so paying for what you take up, pays
for what he takes up.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Would you not have us assured of our
gallants' love?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> For love is better known by liberality
than by jealousy.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> For one may be dissembled, the other not.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
But my jealousy can be no longer dissembled,
and they are telling ripe.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]&mdash;Come, here's to our
gallants in waiting, whom we must name, and I'll begin.
This is my false rogue. [<i>Claps him on the back.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, all will out now. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Did you not tell me, 'twas for my sake
only you reported yourself no man? [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> Oh, wretch! did you not swear to me,
'twas for my love and honour you passed for that thing
you do? [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, so.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Come, speak, ladies: this is my false villain.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> And mine too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dain.</i> And mine.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Well then, you are all three my false rogues
too, and there's an end on't.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Well then, there's no remedy; sister sharers,
let us not fall out, but have a care of our honour.
Though we get no presents, no jewels of him, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
savers of our honour, the jewel of most value and use,
which shines yet to the world unsuspected, though it be
counterfeit.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Nay, and is e'en as good as if it were true, provided
the world think so; for honour, like beauty now,
only depends on the opinion of others.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> Well, Harry Common, I hope you can be true
to three. Swear; but 'tis to no purpose to require your
oath, for you are as often forsworn as you swear to new
women.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Come, faith, madam, let us e'en pardon one
another; for all the difference I find betwixt we men and
you women, we forswear ourselves at the beginning of an
amour, you as long as it lasts.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jasper Fidget</span>, <i>and</i> Old Lady <span class="smcap">Squeamish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Oh, my Lady Fidget, was this your cunning,
to come to Mr. Horner without me? but you have been
nowhere else, I hope.</p>

<p><i>L. Fid.</i> No, Sir Jasper.</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> And you came straight hither, Biddy?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Squeam.</i> Yes, indeed, lady grandmother.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> 'Tis well, 'tis well; I knew when once they
were thoroughly acquainted with poor Horner, they'd
ne'er be from him: you may let her masquerade it
with my wife and Horner, and I warrant her reputation
safe.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Boy.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> O, sir, here's the gentleman come, whom you bid
me not suffer to come up, without giving you notice, with
a lady too, and other gentlemen.</p>

and, boy, do you desire 'em to stay below till I come,
which shall be immediately.

<p><i>Horn.</i> You would not take my advice, to be gone
home before your husband came back, he'll now discover
all; yet pray, my dearest, be persuaded to go home, and
leave the rest to my management; I'll let you down the
back way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> I don't know the way home, so I don't.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> My man shall wait upon you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> No, don't you believe that I'll go at all;
what, are you weary of me already?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, my life, 'tis that I may love you long, 'tis
to secure my love, and your reputation with your husband;
he'll never receive you again else.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What care I? d'ye think to frighten me
with that? I don't intend to go to him again; you shall
be my husband now.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I cannot be your husband, dearest, since you
are married to him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O, would you make me believe that?
Don't I see every day at London here, women leave
their first husbands, and go and live with other men as
their wives? pish, pshaw! you'd make me angry, but
that I love you so mainly.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> So, they are coming up&mdash;In again, in, I hear
'em.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] Well, a silly mistress is
like a weak place, soon got, soon lost, a man has scarce
time for plunder; she betrays her husband first to her
gallant, and then her gallant to her husband.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife, Alithea, Harcourt, Sparkish,
Lucy</span>, <i>and a</i> Parson.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, madam, 'tis not the sudden change of
your dress, the confidence of your asseverations, and
your false witness there, shall persuade me I did not
bring you hither just now; here's my witness, who cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
deny it, since you must be confronted.&mdash;Mr. Horner,
did not I bring this lady to you just now?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Now must I wrong one woman for another's
sake,&mdash;but that's no new thing with me, for in these
cases I am still on the criminal's side against the
innocent. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Pray speak, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> It must be so. I must be impudent, and try
my luck; impudence uses to be too hard for truth. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What, you are studying an evasion or excuse
for her! Speak, sir.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, faith, I am something backward only to
speak in women's affairs or disputes.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> She bids you speak.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Ay, pray, sir, do, pray satisfy him.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Then truly, you did bring that lady to me just
now.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> O ho!</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> How, sir?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> How, Horner?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> What mean you, sir? I always took you for a
man of honour.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Ay, so much a man of honour, that I must save
my mistress, I thank you, come what will on't. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> So, if I had had her, she'd have made me believe
the moon had been made of a Christmas pie.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Now could I speak, if I durst, and solve the
riddle, who am the author of it. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> O unfortunate woman! A combination
against my honour! which most concerns me now,
because you share in my disgrace, sir, and it is your
censure, which I must now suffer, that troubles me, not
theirs.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Madam, then have no trouble, you shall now
see 'tis possible for me to love too, without being
jealous; I will not only believe your innocence myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
but make all the world believe it.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.]
Horner, I must now be concerned for this lady's honour.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And I must be concerned for a lady's honour
too.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> This lady has her honour, and I will protect it.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> My lady has not her honour, but has given it
me to keep, and I will preserve it.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I would not have you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> What's the matter with 'em all?
[<i>Peeping in behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Come, come, Mr. Horner, no more disputing;
here's the parson, I brought him not in vain.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> No, sir, I'll employ him, if this lady please.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> How! what d'ye mean?</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ay, what does he mean?</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Why, I have resigned your sister to him, he has
my consent.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But he has not mine, sir; a woman's injured
honour, no more than a man's, can be repaired or satisfied
by any but him that first wronged it; and you shall
marry her presently, or&mdash;[<i>Lays his hand on his sword.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> O Lord, they'll kill poor Mr. Horner!
besides, he shan't marry her whilst I stand by, and look
on; I'll not lose my second husband so.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> What do I see?</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> My sister in my clothes!</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Nay, pray now don't quarrel about finding
work for the parson, he shall marry me to Mr. Horner;
or now, I believe, you have enough of me.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Damned, damned loving changeling! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Pray, sister, pardon me for telling so
many lies of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> I suppose the riddle is plain now.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, that must be my work.&mdash;Good sir, hear me.
[<i>Kneels to</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>, <i>who stands doggedly with
his hat over his eyes.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I will never hear woman again, but make 'em
all silent thus&mdash;[<i>Offers to draw upon his</i> Wife.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> No, that must not be.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> You then shall go first, 'tis all one to me.
[<i>Offers to draw on</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>, <i>but is stopped by</i>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> What's the matter? what's the matter? pray,
what's the matter, sir? I beseech you communicate, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> Why, my wife has communicated, sir, as your
wife may have done too, sir, if she knows him, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> Pshaw, with him! ha! ha! he!</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> D'ye mock me, sir? a cuckold is a kind of a
wild beast; have a care, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> No, sure, you mock me, sir. He cuckold
you! it can't be, ha! ha! he! why, I'll tell you, sir&mdash;[<i>Offers
to whisper.</i></p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I tell you again, he has whored my wife, and
yours too, if he knows her, and all the women he comes
near; 'tis not his dissembling, his hypocrisy, can wheedle
me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jasp.</i> How! does he dissemble? is he a hypocrite?
Nay, then&mdash;how&mdash;wife&mdash;sister, is he a hypocrite?</p>

<p><i>L. Squeam.</i> A hypocrite! a dissembler! Speak,

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I'll fetch you off, and her too, if she will but
hold her tongue. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lucy. [To</i> <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.] Pray have but patience to
hear me, sir, who am the unfortunate cause of all this
confusion. Your wife is innocent, I only culpable; for
I put her upon telling you all these lies concerning my
mistress, in order to the breaking off the match between
Mr. Sparkish and her, to make way for Mr. Harcourt.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> Did you so, eternal rotten tooth? Then, it
seems, my mistress was not false to me, I was only deceived
by you. Brother, that should have been, now
man of conduct, who is a frank person now, to bring
your wife to her lover, ha?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I assure you, sir, she came not to Mr. Horner
out of love, for she loves him no more&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> Hold, I told lies for you, but you shall
tell none for me, for I do love Mr. Horner with all my
soul, and nobody shall say me nay; pray, don't you go
to make poor Mr. Horner believe to the contrary; 'tis
spitefully done of you, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But does all the town believe it?</p>

<p><i>Quack.</i> Pray, inquire a little, and first of all these.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> I'm sure when I left the town, he was the

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Dorilant</span> <i>whispers with</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pinchwife</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> Come, brother, your wife is yet innocent, you
see; but have a care of too strong an imagination, lest,
like an over-concerned timorous gamester, by fancying an
unlucky cast, it should come. Women and fortune are
truest still to those that trust 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And any wild thing grows but the more fierce
and hungry for being kept up, and more dangerous to
the keeper.</p>

<p><i>Alith.</i> There's doctrine for all husbands, Mr. Harcourt.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> I edify, madam, so much, that I am impatient
till I am one.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And I edify so much by example, I will never be
one.</p>

<p><i>Spark.</i> And because I will not disparage my parts, I'll
ne'er be one.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> And I, alas! can't be one.</p>

<p><i>Pinch.</i> But I must be one&mdash;against my will to a
country wife, with a country murrain to me!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> And I must be a country wife still too, I
find; for I can't, like a city one, be rid of my musty
husband, and do what I list. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Horn.</i> Now, sir, I must pronounce your wife innocent,
though I blush whilst I do it; and I am the only man by
her now exposed to shame, which I will straight drown
in wine, as you shall your suspicion; and the ladies'
troubles we'll divert with a ballad.&mdash;Doctor, where are
your maskers?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Indeed, she's innocent, sir, I am her witness,
and her end of coming out was but to see her sister's
wedding; and what she has said to your face of her love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Mr. Horner, was but the usual innocent revenge on a

<p><i>Mrs. Pinch.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Horner</span>.] Since you'll

<p>According to Wycherley's own statement
<i>The Plain Dealer</i> was written when
the author was twenty-five years of age&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in the year 1665-6.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Its first performance
on the stage cannot have taken place
later than the spring of 1674, as there is an
interesting allusion to it in the preface to Dryden's <i>State of
Innocence</i>, which was registered at Stationers' Hall, April 17,
1674. Dryden writes in terms of noble eulogy: "The author
of <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, whom I am proud to call my friend,
has obliged all honest and virtuous men by one of the most
bold, most general, and most useful satires, which has ever
been presented on the English theatre." <i>The Plain Dealer</i>
was brought forward by the King's Company, probably, like
<i>The Country Wife</i>, at the house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, as
the new theatre, in Drury Lane, was not opened until
March 26 of that year. It was published three years later,
in 1677, the title-page bearing the <i>imprimatur</i>&mdash;"Licensed
Jan. 9, 1676, Roger L'Estrange." The license, of course,
was for printing, not for acting; the date, in new style,
would be 1677.</p>

<p>We shall have, I think, little difficulty in accepting
Wycherley's statement as to the year in which this play was
written, if we suppose, as would almost certainly be the case,
that it was revised and altered before its production on the
stage. The critique on <i>The Country Wife</i>, in particular,
cannot have been written earlier than 1672 or 1673, in one of
which years that comedy was first acted.</p>

<p>Of our author's four comedies <i>The Plain Dealer</i> is, questionless,
the most powerful. From the mock dedication to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the epilogue "the satire, wit, and strength, of manly
Wycherley"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> are everywhere conspicuous and triumphant.
The main purport of the plot, as well as the particular design
of certain scenes, is borrowed from <i>Le Misanthrope</i> of
Molière, but it is almost a truism that the most original
writers are frequently the most extensive plagiarists, and
Wycherley has so overlaid his appropriations with the
colouring of his own brilliant individuality, that his play
appears almost equally a masterpiece of originality as of
ingenuity. It is scarcely too much to say that in <i>The Plain
Dealer</i> we are conscious of a fertility of invention, a richness
of wit and satire, which make even <i>Le Misanthrope</i> seem
tame in comparison. Voltaire has justly contrasted the two
plays. "All Wycherley's strokes," he writes, "are stronger
and bolder than those of our <i>Misanthrope</i>, but then they are
less delicate, and the Rules of Decorum are not so well
observed in this Play."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The scene in the second act, between Olivia, her cousin,
and the two "pretty fellows," Novel and Plausible, was
suggested by a dialogue between Célimène and her admirers,
in the second act of <i>Le Misanthrope</i>, but the detail is almost
entirely Wycherley's own, and is enlivened with such diverting
antitheses and such brilliant fancy that, perhaps, few
scenes more masterly are to be found in the entire range of
English comedy from the time of the Restoration downwards.
In this scene occurs the critique upon <i>The Country
Wife</i>, of which the hint was taken from Molière's <i>Critique de
l'Ecole des Femmes</i>. It is here introduced with great
felicity, and the contrast between the affected prudery of the
vicious Olivia and the simple candour of the truly modest
Eliza is both just and edifying. Again, the discovery by
Novel and Plausible of the duplicity of Olivia, by means of
an exchange of letters, is borrowed from the <i>dénouement</i> of
<i>Le Misanthrope</i>; but the scene in which it occurs owes little
to Molière beyond the incident; and the humorous device
of making each letter, <i>mutato nomine</i>, the exact counterpart
of the other, belongs to Wycherley alone. One or two more
particular coincidences between <i>The Plain Dealer</i> and <i>Le
Misanthrope</i> will be pointed out in the notes.</p>

<p>The admirably conceived character of the Widow Blackacre
has been described as a copy of that of the Countess in
Racine's comedy, <i>Les Plaideurs</i>, surely, in the first instance,
by one of those critics with whom "most authors steal their
works, or buy." There is a litigious old woman in <i>Les
Plaideurs</i>, there is a litigious old woman in <i>The Plain
Dealer</i>; and here the likeness begins and ends.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Voltaire
calls the Widow Blackacre "the most comical character that
was ever brought upon the stage." Lastly, although Fidelia is
imitated from Shakespeare's Viola, and although the imitation
is immeasurably and at all points inferior to the original,
it must be admitted, nevertheless, that she fills her place in
the play with perfect propriety, and is even drawn with some
not inconsiderable degree of sweetness and pathos.</p>

<h3>TO MY LADY B&mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></h3>


<p>Madam,&mdash;</p>

<p>Though I never had the honour to receive
a favour from you, nay, or be known to
you, I take the confidence of an author to
write to you a <i>billet-doux</i> dedicatory;&mdash;which
is no new thing. For by most dedications
it appears that authors, though they
praise their patrons from top to toe, and seem to turn 'em
inside out, know 'em as little as sometimes their patrons their
books, though they read them out; and if the poetical
daubers did not write the name of the man or woman on top
of the picture, 'twere impossible to guess whose it were. But
you, madam, without the help of a poet, have made yourself
known and famous in the world; and because you do not
want it, are therefore most worthy of an epistle dedicatory.
And this play claims naturally your protection, since it has
lost its reputation with the ladies of stricter lives in the playhouse;
and, you know, when men's endeavours are discountenanced
and refused by the nice coy women of honour, they
come to you:&mdash;to you, the great and noble patroness of rejected
and bashful men (of which number I profess myself to
be one, though a poet, a dedicating poet), to you, I say,
madam, who have as discerning a judgment, in what's
obscene or not, as any quick-sighted civil person of 'em all,
and can make as much of a double-meaning saying as the
best of 'em; yet would not, as some do, make nonsense of a
poet's jest, rather than not make it bawdy; by which they
show, they as little value wit in a play as in a lover, provided
they can bring t'other thing about. Their sense, indeed, lies
all one way, and therefore are only for that in a poet, which
is moving, as they say. But what do they mean by that
word "moving?" Well, I must not put 'em to the blush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
since I find I can do't. In short, madam, you would not be
one of those who ravish a poet's innocent words, and make
'em guilty of their own naughtiness (as 'tis termed) in spite of
his teeth. Nay, nothing is secure from the power of their
imaginations, no, not their husbands, whom they cuckold
with themselves, by thinking of other men; and so make the
lawful matrimonial embraces adultery, wrong husbands and
poets in thought and word, to keep their own reputations.
But your ladyship's justice, I know, would think a woman's
arraigning and damning a poet for her own obscenity like
her crying out a rape, and hanging a man for giving her
pleasure, only that she might be thought not to consent to't;
and so to vindicate her honour, forfeits her modesty. But
you, madam, have too much modesty to pretend to't, though
you have as much to say for your modesty as many a nicer
she: for you never were seen at this play, no, not the first
day; and 'tis no matter what people's lives have been, they
are unquestionably modest who frequent not this play. For,
as Mr. Bayes says of his, "That it is the only touchstone of
men's wit and understanding;" mine is, it seems, the only
touchstone of women's virtue and modesty. But hold, that
touchstone is equivocal, and, by the strength of a lady's
imagination, may become something that is not civil: but
your ladyship, I know, scorns to misapply a touchstone.</p>

<p>And, madam, though you have not seen this play, I hope
(like other nice ladies) you will the rather read it. Yet, lest
the chambermaid or page should not be trusted, and their
indulgence could gain no further admittance for it than to
their ladies' lobbies or outward rooms, take it into your care
and protection; for by your recommendation and procurement,
it may have the honour to get into their closets; for
what they renounce in public, often entertains 'em there, with
your help especially. In fine, madam, for these and many
other reasons, you are the fittest patroness or judge of this
play; for you show no partiality to this or that author. For
from some many ladies will take a broad jest as cheerfully as
from the watermen, and sit at some downright filthy plays (as
they call 'em) as well satisfied, and as still, as a poet could
wish 'em elsewhere. Therefore it must be the doubtful
obscenity of my play alone they take exceptions at, because
it is too bashful for 'em: and, indeed, most women hate men
for attempting by halves on their chastity; and bawdy, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
find, like satire, should be home, not to have it taken notice
of. But, now I mention satire, some there are who say, "'Tis
the plain-dealing of the play, not the obscenity; 'tis taking
off the ladies' masks, not offering at their petticoats, which
offends 'em:"&mdash;and generally they are not the handsomest,
or most innocent, who are the most angry at their being discovered:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Nihil est audacius illis</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Deprensis; iram atque animos a crimine sumunt."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Pardon, madam, the quotation; for a dedication can no more
be without ends of Latin, than flattery: and 'tis no matter
whom it is writ to; for an author can as easily, I hope, suppose
people to have more understanding and languages than
they have, as well as more virtues. But why, the devil,
should any of the few modest and handsome be alarmed?&mdash;for
some there are, who, as well as any, deserve those attributes,
yet refrain not from seeing this play, nor think it any
addition to their virtue to set up for it in a playhouse, lest
there it should look too much like acting&mdash;but why, I say,
should any at all of the truly virtuous be concerned, if those
who are not so are distinguished from 'em? for by that mask
of modesty which women wear promiscuously in public, they
are all alike; and you can no more know a kept wench from
a woman of honour by her looks than by her dress. For
those who are of quality without honour (if any such there
are) they have their quality to set off their false modesty, as
well as their false jewels; and you must no more suspect
their countenances for counterfeit than their pendants, though
as the plain dealer Montaigne says, "<i>Els envoy leur conscience
au bordel, et tiennent leur continence en règle</i>." But
those who act as they look, ought not to be scandalised at
the reprehension of others' faults, lest they tax themselves
with 'em, and by too delicate and quick an apprehension not
only make that obscene which I meant innocent, but that
satire on all, which was intended only on those who deserved
it.</p>

<p>But, madam, I beg your pardon for this digression to civil
women and ladies of honour, since you and I shall never be
the better for 'em: for a comic poet and a lady of your profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
make most of the other sort; and the stage and your
houses, like our plantations, are propagated by the least nice
women; and, as with the ministers of justice, the vices of the
age are our best business. But now I mention public persons,
I can no longer defer doing you the justice of a dedication,
and telling you your own, who are, of all public-spirited
people, the most necessary, most communicative, most
generous and hospitable. Your house has been the house of
the people; your sleep still disturbed for the public; and
when you arose, 'twas that others might lie down; and you
waked that others might rest; the good you have done is unspeakable.
How many young inexperienced heirs have you
kept from rash foolish marriages, and from being jilted for
their lives by the worst sort of jilts, wives! How many unbewitched
widowers' children have you preserved from the
tyranny of stepmothers! How many old doters from cuckoldage,
and keeping other men's wenches and children!
How many adulteries and unnatural sins have you prevented!
In fine, you have been a constant scourge to the old lecher,
and often a terror to the young: you have made concupiscence
its own punishment, and extinguished lust with lust,
like blowing up of houses to stop the fire.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Nimirum propter continentiam, incontinentia</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Necessaria est, incendium ignibus exstinguitur."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>There's Latin for you again, madam: I protest to you, as
I am an author, I cannot help it: nay, I can hardly keep
myself from quoting Aristotle and Horace, and talking to
you of the rules of writing (like the French authors), to show
you and my reader I understand 'em, in my epistle, lest
neither of you should find it out by the play. And according
to the rules of dedications, 'tis no matter whether you understand
or no what I quote or say to you of writing; for an
author can as easily make any one a judge or critic in an
epistle, as a hero in his play. But, madam, that this may
prove to the end a true epistle dedicatory, I'd have you to
know 'tis not without a design upon you, which is in the
behalf of the fraternity of Parnassus; that songs and sonnets
may go at your houses, and in your liberties, for guineas and
half-guineas; and that wit, at least with you, as of old, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
be the price of beauty, and so you will prove a true encourager
of poetry; for love is a better help to it than wine;
and poets, like painters, draw better after the life than by
fancy. Nay, in justice, madam, I think a poet ought to be
as free of your houses, as of the play-houses; since he contributes
to the support of both, and is as necessary to such
as you, as a ballad-singer to a pick-purse, in convening the
cullies at the theatres, to be picked up and carried to supper
and bed at your houses. And, madam, the reason of this
motion of mine is, because poor poets can get no favour in
the tiring-rooms, for they are no keepers, you know; and
folly and money, the old enemies of wit, are even too hard
for it on its own dunghill: and for other ladies, a poet can
least go to the price of them. Besides, his wit, which ought
to recommend him to 'em, is as much an obstruction to his
love, as to his wealth or preferment; for most women now-a-days
apprehend wit in a lover, as much as in a husband;
they hate a man that knows 'em, they must have a blind easy
fool, whom they can lead by the nose; and, as the Scythian
women of old, must baffle a man, and put out his eyes, ere
they will lie with him; and then too like thieves, when they
have plundered and stripped a man, leave him. But if there
should be one of a hundred of those ladies generous enough
to give herself to a man that has more wit than money, (all
things considered,) he would think it cheaper coming to you
for a mistress, though you made him pay his guinea; as a
man in a journey (out of good husbandry), had better pay for
what he has at an inn, than lie on free-cost at a gentleman's
house.</p>

<p>In fine, madam, like a faithful dedicator, I hope I have
done myself right in the first place: then you, and your profession,
which in the wisest and most religious government
in the world is honoured with the public allowance; and in
those that are thought the most uncivilised and barbarous is
protected and supported by the ministers of justice. And
of you, madam, I ought to say no more here, for your virtues
deserve a poem rather than an epistle, or a volume entire to
give the world your memoirs, or life at large; and which
(upon the word of an author that has a mind to make an end
of his dedication) I promise to do, when I write the annals of
our British love, which shall be dedicated to the ladies concerned,
if they will not think them something too obscene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
too; when your life, compared with many that are thought
innocent, I doubt not, may vindicate you, and me, to the
world, for the confidence I have taken in this address to you;
which then may be thought neither impertinent nor immodest;
and whatsoever your amorous misfortunes have been,
none can charge you with that heinous, and worst of women's
crimes, hypocrisy; nay, in spite of misfortunes or age, you
are the same woman still; though most of your sex grow
Magdalens at fifty, and as a solid French author has it&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>But sure an old sinner's continency is much like a gamester's
forswearing play, when he had lost all his money; and
modesty is a kind of a youthful dress, which, as it makes a
young woman more amiable, makes an old one more
nauseous: a bashful old woman is like a hopeful old man;
and the affected chastity of antiquated beauties is rather a
reproach than an honour to 'em; for it shows the men's
virtue only, not theirs. But you, in fine, madam, are no
more a hypocrite than I am when I praise you; therefore I
doubt not will be thought (even by yours and the play's
enemies, the nicest ladies) to be the fittest patroness for,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I the Plain Dealer am to act to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And my rough part begins before the play.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">First, you who scribble, yet hate all that write,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And keep each other company in spite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As rivals in your common mistress, fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And with faint praises one another damn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis a good play, we know, you can't forgive,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">But grudge yourselves the pleasure you receive:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our scribbler therefore bluntly bid me say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He would not have the wits pleased here to-day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Next, you, the fine, loud gentlemen o' th' pit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who damn all plays, yet, if y'ave any wit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis but what here you spunge and daily get;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poets, like friends to whom you are in debt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You hate; and so rooks laugh, to see undone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Those pushing gamesters whom they live upon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Well, you are sparks, and still will be i' th' fashion;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rail then at plays, to hide your obligation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, you shrewd judges, who the boxes sway,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Leading the ladies' hearts and sense astray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, for their sakes, see all, and hear no play;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Correct your cravats, foretops, lock behind:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The dress and breeding of the play ne'er mind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Plain dealing is, you'll say, quite out of fashion;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You'll hate it here, as in a dedication:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And your fair neighbours, in a limning poet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No more than in a painter will allow it.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pictures too like the ladies will not please;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They must be drawn too here like goddesses.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You, as at Lely's too, would truncheon wield,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And look like heroes in a painted field.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But the coarse dauber of the coming scenes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To follow life and nature only means,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Displays you as you are, makes his fine woman</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A mercenary jilt, and true to no man:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His men of wit and pleasure of the age</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are as dull rogues as ever cumber'd stage:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He draws a friend only to custom just,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And makes him naturally break his trust.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I, only, act a part like none of you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yet you'll say, it is a fool's part too:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">An honest man who, like you, never winks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At faults; but, unlike you, speaks what he thinks:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The only fool who ne'er found patron yet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For truth is now a fault as well as wit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And where else, but on stages, do we see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Truth pleasing, or rewarded honesty?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which our bold poet does this day in me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If not to th' honest, be to th' prosperous kind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some friends at court let the Plain Dealer find.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Manly's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span>, <i>surlily</i>, Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span>, <i>following him;
and two</i> Sailors <i>behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Tell not me, my good Lord
Plausible, of your decorums, supercilious
forms, and slavish ceremonies!
your little tricks, which you,
the spaniels of the world, do daily
over and over, for and to one another;
not out of love or duty, but
your servile fear.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, i' faith, i' faith, you are too passionate;
and I must humbly beg your pardon and leave to tell
you, they are the arts and rules the prudent of the world
walk by.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Let 'em. But I'll have no leading-strings; I can
walk alone: I hate a harness, and will not tug on in a
faction, kissing my leader behind, that another slave may
do the like to me.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> What, will you be singular then, like nobody?
follow, love, and esteem nobody?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Rather than be general, like you, follow everybody;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
court and kiss everybody; though perhaps at the
same time you hate everybody.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Why, seriously, with your pardon, my dear
friend&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> With your pardon, my no friend, I will not, as
you do, whisper my hatred or my scorn; call a man fool
or knave by signs or mouths over his shoulder, whilst
you have him in your arms.&mdash;For such as you, like
common whores and pickpockets, are only dangerous to
those you embrace.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Such as I! Heavens defend me!&mdash;upon
my honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Upon your title, my lord, if you'd have me believe
you.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Well, then, as I am a person of honour, I
never attempted to abuse or lessen any person in my
life.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What, you were afraid?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> No; but seriously, I hate to do a rude
thing: no, faith, I speak well of all mankind.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I thought so: but know, that speaking well of
all mankind is the worst kind of detraction; for it takes
away the reputation of the few good men in the world, by
making all alike. Now, I speak ill of most men, because
they deserve it; I that can do a rude thing, rather than
an unjust thing.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Well, tell not me, my dear friend, what
people deserve; I ne'er mind that. I, like an author in
a dedication, never speak well of a man for his sake, but
my own; I will not disparage any man, to disparage myself:
for to speak ill of people behind their backs, is not
like a person of honour; and, truly, to speak ill of 'em
to their faces, is not like a complaisant person. But if I
did say or do an ill thing to anybody, it should be sure
to be behind their backs, out of pure good manners.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Very well; but I, that am an unmannerly sea-fellow,
if I ever speak well of people, (which is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
seldom indeed,) it should be sure to be behind their
backs; and if I would say or do ill to any, it should be
to their faces. I would jostle a proud, strutting, overlooking
coxcomb, at the head of his sycophants, rather
than put out my tongue at him when he were past me;
would frown in the arrogant, big, dull face of an overgrown
knave of business, rather than vent my spleen
against him when his back were turned; would give
fawning slaves the lie whilst they embrace or commend
me; cowards whilst they brag; call a rascal by no other
title, though his father had left him a duke's; laugh at
fools aloud before their mistresses; and must desire
people to leave me, when their visits grow at last as
troublesome as they were at first impertinent.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> I would not have my visits troublesome.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> The only way to be sure not to have 'em troublesome,
is to make 'em when people are not at home; for
your visits, like other good turns, are most obliging when
made or done to a man in his absence. A pox! why
should any one, because he has nothing to do, go and
disturb another man's business?</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Here's a finical fellow, Jack! What a brave
fair-weather captain of a ship he would make!</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> He a captain of a ship! it must be when
she's in the dock then; for he looks like one of those
that get the king's commissions for hulls to sell a king's
ship, when a brave fellow has fought her almost to a longboat.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> On my conscience then, Jack, that's the
reason our bully tar sunk our ship; not only that the
Dutch might not have her; but that the courtiers, who
laugh at wooden legs, might not make her prize.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> A pox of his sinking, Tom! we have made
a base, broken, short voyage of it.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Ay, your brisk dealers in honour always
make quick returns with their ships to the dock, and their
men to the hospitals. 'Tis, let me see, just a month since
we set out of the river, and the wind was almost as cross
to us as the Dutch.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Well, I forgive him sinking my own poor
truck, if he would but have given me time and leave to
have saved black Kate of Wapping's small venture.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Faith, I forgive him, since, as the purser told
me, he sunk the value of five or six thousand pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
his own, with which he was to settle himself somewhere
in the Indies; for our merry lieutenant was to succeed
him in his commission for the ship back; for he was resolved
never to return again for England.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> So it seemed, by his fighting.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> No; but he was a-weary of this side of the
world here, they say.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Ay, or else he would not have bid so fair for
a passage into t'other.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Jack, thou thinkest thyself in the forecastle,
thou'rt so waggish. But I tell you, then, he had a mind to
go live and bask himself on the sunny side of the globe.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> What, out of any discontent? for he's always
as dogged as an old tarpaulin, when hindered of a voyage
by a young pantaloon captain.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> 'Tis true I never saw him pleased but in the
fight; and then he looked like one of us coming from the
pay-table, with a new lining to our hats under our arms.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> A pox! he's like the Bay of Biscay, rough
and angry, let the wind blow where 'twill.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Nay, there's no more dealing with him, than
with the land in a storm, no near&mdash;</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> 'Tis a hurry-durry blade. Dost thou remember
after we had tugged hard the old leaky longboat
to save his life, when I welcomed him ashore, he
gave me a box on the ear, and called me fawning water-dog?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Hold thy peace, Jack, and stand by; the
foul weather's coming.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You rascals! dogs! how could this tame thing
get through you?</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Faith, to tell your honour the truth, we were
at hob in the hall,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and whilst my brother and I were
quarrelling about a cast, he slunk by us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> He's a sneaking fellow I warrant for't.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Have more care for the future, you slaves. Go,
and with drawn cutlasses stand at the stair-foot, and keep
all that ask for me from coming up; suppose you were
guarding the scuttle to the powder-room. Let none enter
here, at your and their peril.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> No, for the danger would be the same: you
would blow them and us up, if we should.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Must no one come to you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No man, sir.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> No man, sir; but a woman then, an't like
your honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No woman neither, you impertinent dog!
Would you be pimping? sea-pimp is the strangest monster
she has.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Indeed, an't like your honour, 'twill be hard
for us to deny a woman anything, since we are so newly
come on shore.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> We'll let no old woman come up, though it
were our trusting landlady at Wapping.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Would you be witty, you brandy casks you?
you become a jest as ill as you do a horse. Begone, you
dogs! I hear a noise on the stairs. [<i>Exeunt</i> Sailors.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Faith, I am sorry you would let the fop go, I
intended to have had some sport with him.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Sport with him! A pox! then, why did you
not stay? You should have enjoyed your coxcomb, and
had him to yourself for me.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No, I should not have cared for him without you
neither; for the pleasure which fops afford is like that of
drinking, only good when 'tis shared; and a fool, like a
bottle, which would make you merry in company, will
make you dull alone. But how the devil could you turn
a man of his quality down stairs? You use a lord with
very little ceremony, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> A lord! What, thou art one of those who esteem
men only by the marks and value fortune has set upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
'em, and never consider intrinsic worth! but counterfeit
honour will not be current with me: I weigh the man,
not his title; 'tis not the king's stamp can make
the metal better or heavier. Your lord is a leaden
shilling, which you bend every way, and debases the
stamp he bears, instead of being raised by it.&mdash;Here
again, you slaves!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> Sailors.</p>

<p><i>1st Sail.</i> Only to receive farther instructions, an't like

should we turn him back?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> All men, I say: must I be pestered with you

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Nay, I know one man your honour would
not have us hinder coming to you, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Who's that? speak quickly, slaves.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sail.</i> Why, a man that should bring you a challenge.
For though you refuse money, I'm sure you love
fighting too well to refuse that.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Rogue! rascal! dog! [<i>Kicks the</i> Sailors <i>out.</i></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, let the poor rogues have their forecastle
jests: they cannot help 'em in a fight, scarce when a
ship's sinking.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn their untimely jests! a servant's jest is
more sauciness than his counsel.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But what, will you see nobody? not your
friends?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Friends!&mdash;I have but one, and he, I hear, is
not in town; nay, can have but one friend, for a true
heart admits but of one friendship, as of one love. But
in having that friend, I have a thousand; for he has the
courage of men in despair, yet the diffidency and
caution of cowards; the secrecy of the revengeful, and
the constancy of martyrs; one fit to advise, to keep a
secret, to fight and die for his friend. Such I think
him; for I have trusted him with my mistress in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
absence: and the trust of beauty is sure the greatest we
can show.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, but all your good thoughts are not for him
alone, I hope? Pray, what d'ye think of me for a
friend?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Of thee! Why, thou art a latitudinarian in
friendship, that is, no friend; thou dost side with all
mankind, but wilt suffer for none. Thou art indeed like
your Lord Plausible, the pink of courtesy, therefore hast
no friendship: for ceremony and great professing renders
friendship as much suspected as it does religion.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And no professing, no ceremony at all in friendship,
were as unnatural and as undecent as in religion:
and there is hardly such a thing as an honest hypocrite,
who professes himself to be worse than he is, unless it
be yourself; for though I could never get you to say you
were my friend, I know you'll prove so.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I must confess, I am so much your friend, I
would not deceive you; therefore must tell you, not only
because my heart is taken up, but according to your rules
of friendship, I cannot be your friend.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Pray, why?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Because he that is, you'll say, a true friend to a
man, is a friend to all his friends. But you must pardon
me, I cannot wish well to pimps, flatterers, detractors,
and cowards, stiff nodding knaves, and supple, pliant,
kissing fools. Now, all these I have seen you use like
the dearest friends in the world.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;What, you observed me, I warrant,
in the galleries at Whitehall, doing the business of the
place? Pshaw! Court-professions, like court promises,
go for nothing, man. But, faith, could you think I was
a friend to all those I hugged, kissed, flattered, bowed
to? Ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You told 'em so, and swore it too; I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, but when their backs were turned, did not I
tell you they were rogues, villains, rascals, whom I
despised and hated?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Very fine! But what reason had I to believe
you spoke your heart to me, since you professed deceiving
so many?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, don't you know, good captain, that telling
truth is a quality as prejudicial to a man that would thrive
in the world, as square play to a cheat, or true love to a
whore? Would you have a man speak truth to his ruin?
You are severer than the law, which requires no man to
swear against himself. You would have me speak truth
against myself I warrant, and tell my promising friend
the courtier, he has a bad memory.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And so make him remember to forget my business?
And I should tell the great lawyer too, that he
takes oftener fees to hold his tongue, than to speak?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No doubt on't.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, and have him hang or ruin me, when he
should come to be a judge, and I before him? And you
would have me tell the new officer, who bought his
employment lately, that he is a coward?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And so get myself cashiered, not him, he having
the better friends, though I the better sword? And I
should tell the scribbler of honour, that heraldry were a
prettier and fitter study for so fine a gentleman than
poetry?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And so find myself mauled in his next hired
lampoon? And you would have me tell the holy lady,
too, she lies with her chaplain?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No doubt on't.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And so draw the clergy upon my back, and want
a good table to dine at sometimes? And by the same
reason too, I should tell you that the world thinks you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
mad man, a brutal, and have you cut my throat, or worse,
hate me. What other good success of all my plain-dealing
could I have, than what I've mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, first, your promising courtier would keep
his word out of fear of more reproaches, or at least would
give you no more vain hopes: your lawyer would serve
you more faithfully; for he, having no honour but his
interest, is truest still to him he knows suspects him: the
new officer would provoke thee to make him a coward,
and so be cashiered, that thou, or some other honest
fellow, who had more courage than money, might get his
place: the noble sonnetteer would trouble thee no more
with his madrigals: the praying lady would leave off railing
at wenching before thee, and not turn away her
chambermaid for her own known frailty with thee: and
I, instead of hating thee, should love thee for thy plain
dealing; and in lieu of being mortified, am proud that
the world and I think not well of one another.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, doctors differ. You are for plain dealing,
I find: but against your particular notions, I have the
practice of the whole world. Observe but any morning
what people do when they get together on the Exchange,
in Westminster-hall, or the galleries in Whitehall.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I must confess, there they seem to rehearse
Bayes's grand dance. Here you see a bishop bowing
low to a gaudy atheist; a judge to a door-keeper; a
great lord to a fishmonger, or scrivener with a jack-chain
about his neck; a lawyer to a sergeant-at-arms; a velvet
physician to a threadbare chemist; and a supple gentleman-usher
to a surly beefeater: and so tread round in a
preposterous huddle of ceremony to each other, whilst
they can hardly hold their solemn false countenances.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, they understand the world.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Which I do not, I confess.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But, sir, pray believe the friendship I promise
you real, whatsoever I have professed to others: try me,
at least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, what would you do for me?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I would fight for you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That you would do for your own honour. But
what else?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I would lend you money, if I had it.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To borrow more of me another time. That
were putting your money to interest; a usurer would be
as good a friend.&mdash;But what other piece of friendship?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I would speak well of you to your enemies.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To encourage others to be your friends, by a
show of gratitude.&mdash;But what else?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, I would not hear you ill spoken of behind
your back by my friend.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, then, thou'rt a friend, indeed.&mdash;But it were
unreasonable to expect it from thee, as the world goes
now, when new friends, like new mistresses, are got by
disparaging old ones.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p>But here comes another, will say as much at least.&mdash;Dost
thou not love me devilishly too, my little volunteer, as
well as he or any man can?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Better than any man can love you, my dear
captain.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Look you there, I told you so.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> As well as you do truth or honour, sir; as well.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, good young gentleman, enough, for shame!
Thou hast been a page, by thy flattering and lying, to
one of those praying ladies who love flattery so well they
are jealous of it; and wert turned away for saying the
same things to the old housekeeper for sweetmeats, as
you did to your lady; for thou flatterest everything and
everybody alike.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> You, dear sir, should not suspect the truth of
what I say of you, though to you. Fame, the old liar, is
believed when she speaks wonders of you: you cannot
be flattered, sir, your merit is unspeakable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold, hold, sir, or I shall suspect worse of you,
that you have been a cushion-bearer to some state-hypocrite,
and turned away by the chaplains, for out-flattering
their probation-sermons for a benefice.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Suspect me for anything, sir, but the want of love,
faith, and duty to you, the bravest, worthiest of mankind;
believe me, I could die for you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, there you lie, sir; did not I see thee more
afraid in the fight than the chaplain of the ship, or the
purser that bought his place?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Can he be said to be afraid, that ventures to sea
with you?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Fy! fy! no more; I shall hate thy flattery
worse than thy cowardice, nay, than thy bragging.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Well, I own then I was afraid, mightily afraid;
yet for you I would be afraid again, a hundred times
afraid. Dying is ceasing to be afraid, and that I could
do sure for you, and you'll believe me one day. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Poor youth! believe his eyes, if not his tongue:
he seems to speak truth with them.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What, does he cry? A pox on't! a maudlin
flatterer is as nauseously troublesome as a maudlin
drunkard.&mdash;No more, you little milksop, do not cry, I'll
never make thee afraid again; for of all men, if I had
occasion, thou shouldst not be my second; and when I
go to sea again, thou shalt venture thy life no more with
me.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Why, will you leave me behind then?&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
If you would preserve my life, I'm sure you should not.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Leave thee behind! ay, ay, thou art a hopeful
youth for the shore only. Here thou wilt live to be
cherished by fortune and the great ones; for thou mayst
easily come to outflatter a dull poet, outlie a coffee-house
or gazette-writer, outswear a knight of the post,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> outwatch
a pimp, outfawn a rook, outpromise a lover, outrail
a wit, and outbrag a sea-captain:&mdash;all this thou canst do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
because thou'rt a coward, a thing I hate; therefore thou'lt
do better with the world than with me, and these are the
good courses you must take in the world. There's good
advice, at least, at parting; go, and be happy with't.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Parting, sir! O let me not hear that dismal word.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> If my words frighten thee, begone the sooner;
for to be plain with thee, cowardice and I cannot dwell
together.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> And cruelty and courage never dwelt together
sure, sir. Do not turn me off to shame and misery, for I
am helpless and friendless.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Friendless! there are half a score friends for
thee then.&mdash;[<i>Offers her gold.</i>] I leave myself no more:
they'll help thee a little. Begone, go, I must be cruel to
thee (if thou callest it so) out of pity.</p>

your sword, not gold. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

flirts, who cannot read law-French, though a
gallant writ it. But as I was telling you, my suit&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn these impertinent vexatious people of
business, of all sexes! they are still troubling the world
with the tedious recitals of their lawsuits: and one can
no more stop their mouths than a wit's when he talks of
himself, or an intelligencer's when he talks of other
people.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> And a pox of all vexatious, impertinent lovers!
they are still perplexing the world with the tedious
narrations of their love-suits, and discourses of their
mistresses! You are as troublesome to a poor widow of
business, as a young coxcombly rhyming lover.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And thou art as troublesome to me, as a rook
to a losing gamester, or a young putter of cases to his
mistress or sempstress, who has love in her head for
another.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, since you talk of putting of cases, and will
not hear me speak, hear our Jerry a little; let him put
our case to you, for the trial's to-morrow: and since you
are my chief witness, I would have your memory refreshed
and your judgment informed, that you may not
give your evidence improperly.&mdash;Speak out, child.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Yes, forsooth. Hem! hem! John-a-Stiles&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You may talk, young lawyer, but I shall no
more mind you, than a hungry judge does a cause after
the clock has struck one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, you'll find him as peevish too.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No matter. Jerry, go on.&mdash;Do you observe it
then, sir; for I think I have seen you in a gown once.
Lord, I could hear our Jerry put cases all day long.&mdash;Mark
him, sir.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> John-a-Stiles&mdash;no&mdash;there are first, Fitz, Pere, and
Ayle,&mdash;no, no, Ayle, Pere, and Fitz; Ayle is seised in
fee of Blackacre; John-a-Stiles disseises Ayle; Ayle
makes claim, and the disseisor dies; then the Ayle&mdash;no,
the Fitz&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, the Pere, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Oh, the Pere! ay, the Pere, sir, and the Fitz&mdash;no,
the Ayle,&mdash;no, the Pere and the Fitz, sir, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn Pere, Mere, and Fitz, sir!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, you are out, child.&mdash;Hear me, captain, then.
There are Ayle, Pere, and Fitz; Ayle is seised in fee of
Blackacre; and, being so seised, John-a-Stiles disseises the
Ayle, Ayle makes claim, and the disseisor dies; and then
the Pere re-enters, the Pere, sirrah, the Pere&mdash;[<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>.]
and the Fitz enters upon the Pere, and the Ayle brings
his writ of disseisin in the post; and the Pere brings his
writ of disseisin in the Pere, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Canst thou hear this stuff, Freeman? I could as
soon suffer a whole noise of flatterers at a great man's
levee in a morning; but thou hast servile complacency
enough to listen to a quibbling statesman in disgrace,
nay, and be beforehand with him, in laughing at his dull
no-jest; but I&mdash;[<i>Offering to go out.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, sir, hold! Where's the subp&#339;na, Jerry?
I must serve you, sir. You are required by this, to give
your testimony&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I'll be forsworn to be revenged on thee.
[<i>Exit, throwing away the subp&#339;na.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Get you gone, for a lawless companion!&mdash;Come,
Jerry, I had almost forgot, we were to meet at the
master's at three: let us mind our business still, child.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, forsooth, e'en so let's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, madam, now I would beg you to hear me a
little, a little of my business.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I have business of my own calls me away, sir.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> My business would prove yours too, dear
madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Yours would be some sweet business, I warrant.
What, 'tis no Westminster Hall business? would you
have my advice?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No, faith, 'tis a little Westminster Abbey business;
I would have your consent.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O fy, fy, sir! to me such discourse, before my
dear minor there!</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, ay, mother, he would be taking livery and
seisin of your jointure by digging the turf, but I'll watch
your waters,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> bully, i'fac.&mdash;Come away, mother.

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Dear sir, you have pity; beget but some in our
captain for me.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Where is he?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Within; swearing as much as he did in the great
storm, and cursing you, and sometimes sinks into calms
and sighs, and talks of his Olivia.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> He would never trust me to see her.&mdash;Is she
handsome?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> No, if you'll take my word: but I am not a
proper judge.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> What is she?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> A gentlewoman, I suppose, but of as mean a
fortune as beauty; but her relations would not suffer her
to go with him to the Indies: and his aversion to this
side of the world, together with the late opportunity of
commanding the convoy, would not let him stay here
longer, though to enjoy her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> He loves her mightily then?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Yes, so well, that the remainder of his fortune (I
hear about five or six thousand pounds) he has left her,
in case he had died by the way, or before she could prevail
with her friends to follow him; which he expected
she should do, and has left behind him his great bosom
friend to be her convoy to him.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> What charms has she for him, if she be not
handsome?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> He fancies her, I suppose, the only woman of
truth and sincerity in the world.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No common beauty, I confess.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Or else sure he would not have trusted her with
so great a share of his fortune, in his absence, I suppose
(since his late loss) all he has.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, has he left it in her own custody?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I am told so.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Then he has showed love to her indeed, in
leaving her, like an old husband that dies as soon as he
has made his wife a good jointure.&mdash;But I'll go in to
him, and speak for you, and know more from him of his
Olivia. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His Olivia, indeed, his happy Olivia!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet she was left behind, when I was with him:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But she was ne'er out of his mind or heart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She has told him she loved him; I have show'd it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And durst not tell him so, till I had done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under this habit, such convincing acts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of loving friendship for him, that through it</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He first might find out both my sex and love;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, when I'd had him from his fair Olivia,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And this bright world of artful beauties here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Might then have hoped, he would have look'd on me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Amongst the sooty Indians; and I could,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To choose, there live his wife, where wives are forced</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To live no longer, when their husbands die;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, what's yet worse, to share 'em whilst they live</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With many rival wives. But here he comes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I must yet keep out of his sight, not</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To lose it for ever. [<i>Exit.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But pray what strange charms has she that could
make you love?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Strange charms indeed! she has beauty enough
to call in question her wit or virtue, and her form would
make a starved hermit a ravisher; yet her virtue and
conduct would preserve her from the subtle lust of a
pampered prelate. She is so perfect a beauty, that art
could not better it, nor affectation deform it. Yet all
this is nothing. Her tongue as well as face ne'er knew
artifice; nor ever did her words or looks contradict her
heart. She is all truth, and hates the lying, masking,
daubing world, as I do: for which I love her, and for
which I think she dislikes not me. For she has often
shut out of her conversation for mine, the gaudy fluttering
parrots of the town, apes and echoes of men only,
and refused their common-place pert chat, flattery and
submissions, to be entertained with my sullen bluntness,
and honest love: and, last of all, swore to me, since her
parents would not suffer her to go with me, she would
stay behind for no other man; but follow me without
their leave, if not to be obtained. Which oath&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Did you think she would keep?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes; for she is not (I tell you) like other
women, but can keep her promise, though she has sworn
to keep it. But, that she might the better keep it, I left
her the value of five or six thousand pounds: for women's
wants are generally the most importunate solicitors to
love or marriage.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And money summons lovers more than beauty,
and augments but their importunity, and their number;
so makes it the harder for a woman to deny 'em. For
my part, I am for the French maxim;&mdash;"If you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
have your female subjects loyal, keep 'em poor."&mdash;But
in short, that your mistress may not marry, you have
given her a portion.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> She had given me her heart first, and I am
satisfied with the security; I can never doubt her truth
and constancy.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> It seems you do, since you are fain to bribe it
with money. But how come you to be so diffident of
the man that says he loves you, and not doubt the woman
that says it?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I should, I confess, doubt the love of any other
woman but her, as I do the friendship of any other man
but him I have trusted; but I have such proofs of their
faith as cannot deceive me.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Cannot!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not but I know that generally no man can be a
great enemy but under the name of friend; and if you
are a cuckold, it is your friend only that makes you so,
for your enemy is not admitted to your house: if you are
cheated in your fortune, 'tis your friend that does it, for
your enemy is not made your trustee: if your honour or
good name be injured, 'tis your friend that does it still,
because your enemy is not believed against you. Therefore,
I rather choose to go where honest, downright
barbarity is professed, where men devour one another
like generous hungry lions and tigers, not like crocodiles;
where they think the devil white, of our complexion;
and I am already so far an Indian. But if your weak
faith doubts this miracle of a woman, come along with
me, and believe; and thou wilt find her so handsome,
that thou, who art so much my friend, wilt have a mind
to lie with her, and so wilt not fail to discover what her
faith and thine is to me.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When we're in love, the great adversity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our friends and mistresses at once we try.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Olivia's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>, <span class="smcap">Eliza</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ah, cousin, what a world 'tis we
live in! I am so weary of it.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Truly, cousin, I can find no
fault with it, but that we cannot always
live in't, for I can never be
weary of it.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O hideous! you cannot be in
earnest sure, when you say you like the filthy world.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You cannot be in earnest sure, when you say
you dislike it.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You are a very censorious creature, I find.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> I must confess, I think we women as often discover
where we love by railing, as men when they lie by
their swearing; and the world is but a constant keeping
gallant, whom we fail not to quarrel with when anything
crosses us, yet cannot part with't for our hearts.</p>

<p><i>Let.</i> A gallant indeed, madam, whom ladies first make
jealous, and then quarrel with it for being so; for if, by
her indiscretion, a lady be talked of for a man, she cries
presently, "'Tis a censorious world!" if by her vanity
the intrigue be found out, "'Tis a prying malicious
world!" if by her over-fondness the gallant proves unconstant,
"'Tis a false world!" and if by her niggardliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
the chambermaid tells, "'Tis a perfidious world!"
But that, I'm sure, your ladyship cannot say of the world
yet, as bad as 'tis.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But I may say, "'Tis a very impertinent world!"&mdash;Hold
your peace.&mdash;And, cousin, if the world be a
gallant, 'tis such a one as is my aversion. Pray name it
no more.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> But is it possible the world, which has such
variety of charms for other women, can have none for
you? Let's see&mdash;first, what d'ye think of dressing and
fine clothes?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Dressing! Fy, fy, 'tis my aversion.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.]
But come hither, you dowdy; methinks you might
have opened this toure better; O hideous! I cannot
suffer it! D'ye see how't sits?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Well enough, cousin, if dressing be your aversion.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> 'Tis so: and for variety of rich clothes, they are
more my aversion.</p>

<p><i>Let.</i> Ay, 'tis because your ladyship wears 'em too long;
for indeed a gown, like a gallant, grows one's aversion by
having too much of it.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Insatiable creature! I'll be sworn I have had
this not above three days, cousin, and within this month
have made some six more.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Then your aversion to 'em is not altogether so
great.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Alas! 'tis for my woman only I wear 'em,
cousin.</p>

<p><i>Let.</i> If it be for me only, madam, pray do not wear
'em.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> But what d'ye think of visits&mdash;balls?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, I detest 'em!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Of plays?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I abominate 'em; filthy, obscene, hideous things.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> What say you to masquerading in the winter,
and Hyde Park in the summer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Insipid pleasures I taste not.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Nay, if you are are for more solid pleasures, what
think you of a rich young husband?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O horrid! marriage! what a pleasure you have
found out! I nauseate it of all things.</p>

<p><i>Let.</i> But what does your ladyship think then of a
liberal handsome young lover?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> A handsome young fellow, you impudent!
begone out of my sight. Name a handsome young
fellow to me! foh, a hideous handsome young fellow I
abominate! [<i>Spits.</i></p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Indeed! But let's see&mdash;will nothing please
you? what d'ye think of the court?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> How, the court! the court, cousin! my aversion,
my aversion, my aversion of all aversions!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> How, the court! where&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Where sincerity is a quality as much out of
fashion and as unprosperous as bashfulness: I could not
laugh at a quibble, though it were a fat privy-counsellor's;
nor praise a lord's ill verses, though I were myself the
subject; nor an old lady's young looks, though I were
her woman; nor sit to a vain young smile-maker, though
he flattered me. In short, I could not glout<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> upon a
man when he comes into a room, and laugh at him when
he goes out; I cannot rail at the absent to flatter the
standers-by; I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Well, but railing now is so common, that 'tis
no more malice, but the fashion; and the absent think
they are no more the worse for being railed at, than the
present think they're the better for being flattered. And
for the court&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, do not defend the court; for you'll make
me rail at it like a trusting citizen's widow.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Or like a Holborn lady, who could not get in
to the last ball, or was out of countenance in the drawing-room
the last Sunday of her appearance there. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
none rail at the court but those who cannot get into it,
or else who are ridiculous when they are there; and I
shall suspect you were laughed at when you were last
there, or would be a maid of honour.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I a maid of honour! To be a maid of honour,
were yet of all things my aversion.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> In what sense am I to understand you? But
in fine, by the word aversion, I'm sure you dissemble;
for I never knew woman yet used it who did not.
Come, our tongues belie our hearts more than our
pocket-glasses do our faces. But methinks we ought to
leave off dissembling, since 'tis grown of no use to us;
for all wise observers understand us now-a-days, as they
do dreams, almanacs, and Dutch gazettes, by the contrary:
and a man no more believes a woman, when she
says she has an aversion for him, than when she says
she'll cry out.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O filthy! hideous! Peace, cousin, or your
discourse will be my aversion: and you may believe
me.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Yes; for if anything be a woman's aversion,
'tis plain dealing from another woman: and perhaps
that's your quarrel to the world; for that will talk, as
your woman says.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Talk? not of me sure; for what men do I
converse with? what visits do I admit?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Boy.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Here's the gentleman to wait upon you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> On me! you little unthinking fop; d'ye know
what you say?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Yes, madam, 'tis the gentleman that comes
every day to you, who&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Hold your peace, you heedless little animal, and
get you gone.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Boy.] This country boy, cousin,
takes my dancing-master, tailor, or the spruce milliner,
for visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Let.</i> No, madam; 'tis Mr. Novel, I'm sure, by his
talking so loud: I know his voice too, madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You know nothing, you buffle-headed stupid
creature you: you would make my cousin believe I
receive visits. But if it be Mr.&mdash;what did you call
him?</p>

<p><i>Let.</i> Mr. Novel, madam; he that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Hold your peace; I'll hear no more of him.
But if it be your Mr.&mdash;(I cannot think of his name again)
I suppose he has followed my cousin hither.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> No, cousin, I will not rob you of the honour of
the visit: 'tis to you, cousin; for I know him not.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nor did I ever hear of him before, upon my
honour, cousin; besides, han't I told you, that visits, and
the business of visits, flattery and detraction, are my aversion?
D'ye think then I would admit such a coxcomb as
he is? who rather than not rail, will rail at the dead,
whom none speak ill of; rather than not flatter, will
flatter the poets of the age, whom none will flatter; who
affects novelty as much as the fashion, and is as fantastical
as changeable, and as well known as the fashion; who
likes nothing but what is new, nay, would choose to have
his friend or his title a new one. In fine, he is my
aversion.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> I find you do know him, cousin; at least, have
heard of him.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Yes, now I remember. I have heard of him.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Well; but since he is such a coxcomb, for
Heaven's sake, let him not come up. Tell him, Mrs.
Lettice, your lady is not within.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, Lettice, tell him my cousin is here, and that
he may come up. For notwithstanding I detest the sight
of him, you may like his conversation; and though I
would use him scurvily, I will not be rude to you in my
own lodging: since he has followed you hither, let him
come up, I say.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Very fine! pray let him go to the devil, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
for me: I know him not, nor desire it. Send him away,
Mrs. Lettice.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Upon my word, she shan't: I must disobey your
commands, to comply with your desires. Call him up,
Lettice.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Nay, I'll swear she shall not stir on that errand.
[<i>Holds</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well then, I'll call him myself for you, since you
will have it so.&mdash;[<i>Calls out at the door.</i>] Mr. Novel,
sir, sir!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Madam, I beg your pardon; perhaps you were
busy: I did not think you had company with you.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Yet he comes to me, cousin!
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Chairs there. [<i>They sit.</i></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well; but, madam, d'ye know whence I come
now?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> From some melancholy place, I warrant, sir,
since they have lost your good company.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> So!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> From a place where they have treated me at
dinner with so much civility and kindness, a pox on
them! that I could hardly get away to you, dear
madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You have a way with you so new and obliging,
sir!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You hate flattery, cousin! [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay, faith, madam, d'ye think my way new?
Then you are obliging, madam. I must confess, I hate
imitation, to do anything like other people. All that
know me do me the honour to say, I am an original,
faith. But, as I was saying, madam, I have been treated
to-day with all the ceremony and kindness imaginable at
my Lady Autumn's. But, the nauseous old woman at
the upper end of her table&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Revives the old Grecian custom, of serving in a
death's head with their banquets.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! ha! fine, just, i'faith, nay, and new. 'Tis
like eating with the ghost in "The Libertine:"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> she
would frighten a man from her dinner with her hollow
invitations, and spoil one's stomach&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> To meat or women. I detest her hollow cherry
cheeks: she looks like an old coach new painted;
affecting an unseemly smugness, whilst she is ready to
drop in pieces.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You hate detraction, I see, cousin.
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> But the silly old fury, whilst she affects to look
like a woman of this age, talks&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Like one of the last; and as passionately as an
old courtier who has outlived his office.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Yes, madam; but pray let me give you her
character. Then she never counts her age by the years,
but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> By the masques she has lived to see.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay then, madam, I see you think a little harmless
railing too great a pleasure for any but yourself; and
therefore I've done.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, faith, you shall tell me who you had there
at dinner.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> If you would hear me, madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Most patiently; speak, sir.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then, we had her daughter&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, her daughter; the very disgrace to good
clothes, which she always wears but to heighten her
deformity, not mend it: for she is still most splendidly,
gallantly ugly, and looks like an ill piece of daubing in a
rich frame.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> So! But have you done with her, madam? and
can you spare her to me a little now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, ay, sir.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then, she is like&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> She is, you'd say, like a city bride; the greater
fortune, but not the greater beauty, for her dress.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well: yet have you done, madam? Then she&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Then she bestows as unfortunately on her face
all the graces in fashion, as the languishing eye, the
hanging or pouting lip. But as the fool is never more
provoking than when he aims at wit, the ill-favoured of
our sex are never more nauseous than when they would
be beauties, adding to their natural deformity the artificial
ugliness of affectation.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> So, cousin, I find one may have a collection of
all one's acquaintance's pictures as well at your house as
at Mr. Lely's.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Only the difference is, there we find 'em
much handsomer than they are, and like; here much
uglier, and like: and you are the first of the profession
of picture-drawing I ever knew without flattery.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I draw after the life; do nobody wrong, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> No, you hate flattery and detraction.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But, Mr. Novel, who had you besides at dinner?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay, the devil take me if I tell you, unless you
will allow me the privilege of railing in my turn.&mdash;But,
now I think on't, the women ought to be your province,
as the men are mine: and you must know we had him
whom&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Him, whom&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> What, invading me already? and giving the
character before you know the man?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> No, that is not fair, though it be usual.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I beg your pardon, Mr. Novel; pray go on.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then, I say, we had that familiar coxcomb who
is at home wheresoe'er he comes.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, that fool&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay then, madam, your servant; I'm gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
Taking the fool out of one's mouth is worse than taking
the bread out of one's mouth.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I've done; your pardon, Mr. Novel: pray proceed.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> I say, the rogue, that he may be the only wit in
company, will let nobody else talk, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, those fops who love to talk all themselves
are of all things my aversion.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then you'll let me speak, madam, sure. The
rogue, I say, will force his jest upon you; and I hate a
jest that's forced upon a man, as much as a glass.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Why, I hope, sir, he does not expect a man of
your temperance in jesting should do him reason?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> What! interruption from this side too? I must
then&mdash;[<i>Offers to rise.</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span> <i>holds him.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, sir.&mdash;You must know, cousin, that fop he
means, though he talks only to be commended, will not
give you leave to do't.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> But, madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> He a wit! Hang him; he's only an adopter of
straggling jests and fatherless lampoons; by the credit of
which he eats at good tables, and so, like the barren
beggar-woman, lives by borrowed children.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And never was author of anything but his news;
but that is still all his own.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Madam, pray&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> An eternal babbler; and makes no more use of
his ears, than a man that sits at a play by his mistress, or
in Fop-corner. He's, in fine, a base detracting fellow,
and is my aversion.&mdash;But who else, prithee Mr. Novel,
was there with you? Nay, you shan't stir.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> I beg your pardon, madam; I cannot stay in any
place where I'm not allowed a little Christian liberty of
railing.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, prithee Mr. Novel, stay: and though you
should rail at me, I would hear you with patience.
Prithee, who else was there with you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Your servant, madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, prithee tell us, Mr. Novel, prithee do.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> We had nobody else.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, faith, I know you had. Come, my Lord
Plausible was there too; who is, cousin, a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You need not tell me what he is, cousin; for
I know him to be a civil, good-natured, harmless gentleman,
that speaks well of all the world, and is always in
good-humour; and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Hold, cousin, hold; I hate detraction. But I
must tell you, cousin, his civility is cowardice, his good-nature
want of wit; and he has neither courage nor sense
to rail: and for his being always in humour, 'tis because
he is never dissatisfied with himself. In fine, he is my
aversion; and I never admit his visits beyond my
hall.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> No, he visit you! Damn him, cringing grinning
rogue! if I should see him coming up to you, I would
make bold to kick him down again.&mdash;Ha!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span>.</p>

<p>My dear lord, your most humble servant.
[<i>Rises and salutes</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span>, <i>and kisses him.</i></p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> So, I find kissing and railing succeed each other
with the angry men as well as with the angry women; and
their quarrels are like love-quarrels, since absence is the
only cause of them; for as soon as the man appears
again, they are over. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Your most faithful humble servant, generous
Mr. Novel. And, madam, I am your eternal slave, and
kiss your fair hands; which I had done sooner, according
to your commands, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No excuses, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> What, you sent for him then, cousin?
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! invited! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I know you must divide yourself; for your good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
company is too general a good to be engrossed by any
particular friend.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> O Lord, madam, my company! your most
obliged, faithful, humble servant. But I could have
brought you good company indeed; for I parted at your
door with two of the worthiest, bravest men&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Who were they, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Who do you call the worthiest, bravest men, pray?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> O, the wisest, bravest gentlemen! men of
such honour and virtue! of such good qualities! ah&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> This is a coxcomb that speaks ill of all people
a different way, and libels everybody with dull praise, and
commonly in the wrong place; so makes his panegyrics
abusive lampoons. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But pray let me know who they were?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Ah! such patterns of heroic virtue! such&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well: but who the devil were they?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The honour of our nation! the glory of our
age! Ah, I could dwell a twelvemonth on their praise;
which indeed I might spare by telling their names; Sir
John Current and Sir Richard Court-Title.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Court-Title! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And Sir John Current! Why will you keep such
a wretch company, my lord?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> O madam, seriously you are a little too severe;
for he is a man of unquestioned reputation in everything.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Yes, because he endeavours only with the women
to pass for a man of courage, and with the bullies for a
wit; with the wits for a man of business, and with the
men of business for a favourite at court; and at court for
city security.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And for Sir Richard, he&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> He loves your choice picked company, persons
that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> He loves a lord indeed; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Pray, dear madam, let me have but a bold stroke
or two at his picture. He loves a lord, as you say, though&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Though he borrowed his money, and ne'er paid
him again.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And would bespeak a place three days before at
the back-end of a lord's coach to Hyde Park.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, i'faith, i'faith, you are both too severe.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Then to show yet more his passion for quality,
he makes love to that fulsome coach-load of honour, my
Lady Goodly, for he's always at her lodging.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Because it is the conventicle-gallant, the
meeting-house of all the fair ladies, and glorious superfine
beauties of the town.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Very fine ladies! there's first&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Her honour, as fat as an hostess.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She is something plump indeed, a goodly,
comely, graceful person.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then there's my Lady Frances&mdash;what d'ye call
her? as ugly&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As a citizen's lawfully begotten daughter.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She has wit in abundance, and the handsomest
heel, elbow, and tip of an ear, you ever saw.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Heel and elbow! ha! ha! And there's my Lady
Betty, you know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As sluttish and slatternly as an Irish woman bred
in France.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Ah! all she has hangs with a loose air, indeed,
and becoming negligence.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You see all faults with lovers' eyes, I find, my
lord.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Ah, madam, your most obliged, faithful,
humble servant to command! But you can say nothing
sure against the superfine mistress&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I know who you mean. She is as censorious
and detracting a jade as a superannuated sinner.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She has a smart way of raillery, 'tis confessed.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And then for Mrs. Grideline&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She, I'm sure is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> One that never spoke ill of anybody, 'tis confessed.
For she is as silent in conversation as a country
lover, and no better company than a clock, or a weather-glass:
for if she sounds, 'tis but once an hour to put you
in mind of the time of day, or to tell you 'twill be cold or
hot, rain or snow.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Ah, poor creature! she's extremely good and
modest.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And for Mrs. Bridlechin, she's&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As proud as a churchman's wife.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She's a woman of great spirit and honour,
and will not make herself cheap, 'tis true.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Then Mrs. Hoyden, that calls all people by their
surnames, and is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As familiar a duck&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> As an actress in the tiring room. There I was
once beforehand with you, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Mrs. Hoyden! a poor, affable, good-natured
soul. But the divine Mrs. Trifle comes thither too.
Sure her beauty, virtue, and conduct, you can say
nothing to.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> No!&mdash;Pray let me speak, madam.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> First, can any one be called beautiful that
squints?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Her eyes languish a little, I own.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Languish! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Languish!&mdash;Then, for her conduct, she was
seen at the "Country Wife" after the first day. There's
for you, my lord.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> But, madam, she was not seen to use her
fan all the play long, turn aside her head, or by a
conscious blush discover more guilt than modesty.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Very fine! Then you think a woman modest
that sees the hideous "Country Wife" without blushing
or publishing her detestation of it? D'ye hear him,
cousin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Yes, and am, I must confess, something of his
opinion; and think, that as an over-conscious fool at a
play, by endeavouring to show the author's want of wit,
exposes his own to more censure, so may a lady call her
own modesty in question, by publicly cavilling with the
poet's. For all those grimaces of honour and artificial
modesty disparage a woman's real virtue, as much as the
use of white and red does the natural complexion: and
you must use very, very little, if you would have it thought
your own.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Then you would have a woman of honour with
passive looks, ears, and tongue, undergo all the hideous
obscenity she hears at nasty plays.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Truly, I think a woman betrays her want of
modesty, by showing it publicly in a playhouse, as much
as a man does his want of courage by a quarrel there;
for the truly modest and stout say least, and are least
exceptious, especially in public.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O hideous, cousin! this cannot be your opinion.
But you are one of those who have the confidence to
pardon the filthy play.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Why, what is there of ill in't, say you?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O fy! fy! fy! would you put me to the blush
anew? call all the blood into my face again? But to
satisfy you then; first, the clandestine obscenity in the
very name of Horner.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Truly, 'tis so hidden, I cannot find it out, I
confess.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O horrid! Does it not give you the rank conception
or image of a goat, or town-bull, or a satyr? nay,
what is yet a filthier image than all the rest, that of an
eunuch?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> What then? I can think of a goat, a bull, or a
satyr, without any hurt.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay: but cousin, one cannot stop there.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> I can, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O no; for when you have those filthy creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
in your head once, the next thing you think, is what they
do; as their defiling of honest men's beds and couches,
rapes upon sleeping and waking country virgins under
hedges, and on haycocks. Nay, farther&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Nay, no farther, cousin. We have enough of
your comment on the play, which will make me more
ashamed than the play itself.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, believe me, 'tis a filthy play! and you may
take my word for a filthy play as soon as another's.
But the filthiest thing in that play, or any other play,
is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Pray keep it to yourself, if it be so.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, faith, you shall know it; I'm resolved to
make you out of love with the play. I say, the lewdest,
filthiest thing is his china; nay, I will never forgive the
beastly author his china. He has quite taken away the
reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most
innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber;
insomuch that I was fain to break all my defiled vessels.
You see I have none left; nor you, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You'll pardon me, I cannot think the worse of
my china for that of the playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Why, you will not keep any now, sure! 'Tis
now as unfit an ornament for a lady's chamber as the
pictures that come from Italy and other hot countries;
as appears by their nudities, which I always cover, or
scratch out, whereso'er I find 'em. But china! out
upon't, filthy china! nasty debauched china!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> All this will not put me out of conceit with
china, nor the play, which is acted to-day, or another of
the same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go
see.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You will not, sure! nay, you sha' not venture
your reputation by going, and mine by leaving me alone
with two men here: nay, you'll disoblige me for ever, if&mdash;[<i>Pulls
her back.</i></p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> I stay!&mdash;your servant. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well&mdash;but, my lord, though you justify everybody,
you cannot in earnest uphold so beastly a writer,
whose ink is so smutty as one may say.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Faith, I dare swear the poor man did not
think to disoblige the ladies, by any amorous, soft,
passionate, luscious saying in his play.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Fy, my lord! But what think you, Mr. Novel, of
the play? though I know you are a friend to all that are
new.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Faith, madam, I must confess, the new plays
would not be the worse for my advice, but I could never
get the silly rogues, the poets, to mind what I say; but
I'll tell you what counsel I gave the surly fool you
spake of.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What was't?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Faith, to put his play into rhyme; for rhyme,
you know, often makes mystical nonsense pass with the
critics for wit, and a double-meaning saying with the
ladies, for soft, tender, and moving passion. But now I
talk of passion, I saw your old lover this morning&mdash;Captain&mdash;[<i>Whispers.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly, Freeman</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span> <i>standing behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Whom?&mdash;nay, you need not whisper.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> We are luckily got hither unobserved!&mdash;How!
in a close conversation with these supple rascals, the outcasts
of sempstresses' shops!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Faith, pardon her, captain, that, since she could
no longer be entertained with your manly bluntness and
honest love, she takes up with the pert chat and commonplace
flattery of these fluttering parrots of the town, apes
and echoes of men only.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Do not you, sir, play the echo too, mock me,
dally with my own words, and show yourself as impertinent
as they are.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, captain&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, lieutenant, do not excuse her; methinks she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
looks very kindly upon 'em both, and seems to be pleased
with what that fool there says to her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You lie, sir! and hold your peace, that I may
not be provoked to give you a worse reply.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Manly returned, d'ye say! and is he safe?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> My lord saw him too.&mdash;Hark you, my lord.
[<i>Whispers to</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> She yet seems concerned for my safety, and perhaps
they are admitted now here but for their news of
me: for intelligence indeed is the common passport of
nauseous fools, when they go their round of good tables
and houses. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I heard of his fighting only, without particulars,
and confess I always loved his brutal courage, because
it made me hope it might rid me of his more brutal
love.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What's that? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But is he at last returned, d'ye say, unhurt?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ay, faith, without doing his business; for the
rogue has been these two years pretending to a wooden
leg, which he would take from fortune as kindly as the
staff of a marshal of France, and rather read his name in
a gazette&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Than in the entail of a good estate.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> So! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> I have an ambition, I must confess, of losing my
heart before such a fair enemy us yourself, madam; but
that silly rogues should be ambitious of losing their arms,
and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Looking like a pair of compasses.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> But he has no use of his arms but to set 'em on
kimbow, for he never pulls off his hat, at least not to me,
I'm sure; for you must know, madam, he has a fanatical
hatred to good company: he can't abide me.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> O, be not so severe to him, as to say he hates
good company: for I assure you he has a great respect,
esteem and kindness for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That kind, civil rogue has spoken yet ten thousand
times worse of me than t'other. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well, if he be returned, Mr. Novel, then shall I
be pestered again with his boisterous sea-love; have my
alcove smell like a cabin, my chamber perfumed with his
tarpaulin Brandenburgh; and hear volleys of brandy-sighs,
enough to make a fog in one's room. Foh! I hate
a lover that smells like Thames Street!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I can bear no longer, and need hear no
more.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.] But since you have these two
pulvillio<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> boxes, these essence-bottles, this pair of
musk-cats here, I hope I may venture to come yet nearer
you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Overheard us then!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> I hope he heard me not. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Most noble and heroic captain, your most
obliged, faithful, humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Dear tar, thy humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Away!&mdash;[<i>Thrusts</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span> <i>and</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span>
<i>on each side.</i>] Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, I think I have fitted<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> you for listening.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You have fitted me for believing you could not
be fickle, though you were young; could not dissemble
love, though 'twas your interest; nor be vain, though you
were handsome; nor break your promise, though to a
parting lover; nor abuse your best friend, though you had
wit: but I take not your contempt of me worse than your
esteem, or civility for these things here, though you know
'em.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Things!</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Let the captain rally a little.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, things! Canst thou be angry, thou thing?
[<i>Coming up to</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> No, since my lord says you speak in raillery; for
though your sea-raillery be something rough, yet, I confess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
we use one another too as bad every day at Locket's,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
and never quarrel for the matter.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, noble captain, be not angry with him.&mdash;A
word with you, I beseech you&mdash;[<i>Whispers
to</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well, we women, like the rest of the cheats of
the world, when our cullies or creditors have found us out,
and will or can trust no longer, pay debts and satisfy
obligations with a quarrel, the kindest present a man can
make to his mistress, when he can make no more
presents. For oftentimes in love, as at cards, we are
forced to play foul, only to give over the game; and
use our lovers like the cards, when we can get no more
by them, throw 'em up in a pet upon the first dispute.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> My lord, all that you have made me know by
your whispering, which I knew not before, is, that you
have a stinking breath; there's a secret for your secret.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Pshaw! pshaw!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But, madam, tell me, pray, what was't about this
spark could take you? Was it the merit of his fashionable
impudence; the briskness of his noise, the wit of his
laugh, his judgment, or fancy in his garniture? or was it
a well-trimmed glove, or the scent of it, that charmed
you?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Very well, sir: 'gad these sea captains make
nothing of dressing. But let me tell you, sir, a man by
his dress, as much as by anything, shows his wit and
judgment; nay, and his courage too.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> How, his courage, Mr. Novel?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Why, for example, by red breeches, tucked-up
hair or peruke, a greasy broad belt, and now-a-days a
short sword.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thy courage will appear more by thy belt than
thy sword, I dare swear.&mdash;Then, madam, for this gentle
piece of courtesy, this man of tame honour, what could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
you find in him? Was it his languishing affected tone?
his mannerly look? his second-hand flattery? the refuse
of the playhouse tiring-rooms? or his slavish obsequiousness
in watching at the door of your box at the playhouse,
for your hand to your chair? or his jaunty way of playing
with your fan? or was it the gunpowder spot on his
hand, or the jewel in his ear, that purchased your heart?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Good jealous captain, no more of your&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> No, let him go on, madam, for perhaps he
may make you laugh: and I would contribute to your
pleasure any way.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Gentle rogue!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, noble captain, you cannot sure think anything
could take me more than that heroic title of yours,
captain; for you know we women love honour inordinately.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! ha! faith, she is with thee, bully, for thy
raillery.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Faith, so shall I be with you, no bully, for your
grinning. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Then that noble lion-like mien of yours, that
soldier-like, weather-beaten complexion, and that manly
roughness of your voice; how can they otherwise than
charm us women, who hate effeminacy!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! ha! faith I can't hold from laughing.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nor shall I from kicking anon. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And then, that captain-like carelessness in your
dress, but especially your scarf; 'twas just such another,
only a little higher tied, made me in love with my tailor
as he passed by my window the last training-day; for we
women adore a martial man, and you have nothing wanting
to make you more one, or more agreeable, but a
wooden leg.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, i'faith, there your ladyship was a wag,
and it was fine, just, and well rallied.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ay, ay, madam, with you ladies too, martial men
must needs be very killing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Peace, you Bartholomew-fair buffoons! And be
not you vain that these laugh on your side, for they will
laugh at their own dull jests; but no more of 'em, for I
will only suffer now this lady to be witty and merry.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You would not have your panegyric interrupted.
I go on then to your humour. Is there anything more
agreeable than the pretty sullenness of that? than the
greatness of your courage, which most of all appears in
your spirit of contradiction? for you dare give all mankind
the lie; and your opinion is your only mistress,
for you renounce that too, when it becomes another
man's.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! ha! I cannot hold, I must laugh at thee,
tar, faith!</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> And i'faith, dear captain, I beg your pardon,
and leave to laugh at you too, though I protest I mean
you no hurt; but when a lady rallies, a stander-by must
be complaisant, and do her reason in laughing: ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, you impudent, pitiful wretches, you presume
sure upon your effeminacy to urge me; for you are
in all things so like women, that you may think it in me
a kind of cowardice to beat you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No hectoring, good captain.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Or, perhaps, you think this lady's presence
secures you; but have a care, she has talked herself out
of all the respect I had for her; and by using me ill
before you, has given me a privilege of using you so
before her; but if you would preserve your respect to
her, and not be beaten before her, go, begone
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Begone! what?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, worthy, noble, generous, captain&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Begone, I say!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Begone again! to us begone!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No chattering, baboons, instantly begone, or&mdash;[<i>Puts
them out of the room:</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span> <i>struts,</i>
Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span> <i>cringes.</i></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well, madam, we'll go make the cards ready in
your bedchamber: sure you will not stay long with him.
[<i>Exeunt</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Novel.</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Turn hither your rage, good captain Swaggerhuff,
and be saucy with your mistress, like a true captain;
but be civil to your rivals and betters, and do not
threaten anything but me here; no, not so much as my
windows; nor do not think yourself in the lodgings of
one of your suburb mistresses beyond the Tower.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Do not give me cause to think so; for those less
infamous women part with their lovers, just as you did
from me, with unforced vows of constancy and floods of
willing tears; but the same winds bear away their lovers
and their vows: and for their grief, if the credulous
unexpected fools return, they find new comforters, fresh
cullies, such as I found here. The mercenary love of
those women too suffers shipwreck with their gallants'
fortunes; now you have heard chance has used me
scurvily, therefore you do too. Well, persevere in your
ingratitude, falsehood, and disdain; have constancy in
something, and I promise you to be as just to your real
scorn as I was to your feigned love; and henceforward
will despise, contemn, hate, loathe, and detest you most
faithfully.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Get the ombre-cards ready in the next room,
Lettice, and&mdash;[<i>Whispers to</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>, <i>who goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Bravely resolved, captain!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> And you'll be sure to keep your word, I hope, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I hope so too.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Do you but hope it, sir? If you are not as good
as your word, 'twill be the first time you ever bragged,
sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> She has restored my reason with my heart.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But now you talk of restoring, captain, there are
other things, which next to one's heart one would not
part with; I mean your jewels and money, which it
seems she has, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What's that to you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Pardon me, whatsoever is yours I have a share
in't I'm sure, which I will not lose for asking, though you
may be too generous or too angry now to do't yourself.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, then I'll make bold to make my claim too.
[<i>Both going towards</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold, you impertinent, officious fops&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
How have I been deceived!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Madam, there are certain appurtenances to a
lover's heart, called jewels, which always go along
with it.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> And which, with lovers, have no value in themselves,
but from the heart they come with. Our captain's,
madam, it seems you scorn to keep, and much more will
those worthless things without it, I am confident.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> A gentleman so well made as you are, may be
confident&mdash;us easy women could not deny you anything
you ask, if 'twere for yourself, but, since 'tis for another,
I beg your leave to give him my answer.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] An
agreeable young fellow this&mdash;and would not be my aversion.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Captain, your young friend here has a
very persuading face, I confess; yet you might have
asked me yourself for those trifles you left with me, which
(hark you a little, for I dare trust you with the secret;
you are a man of so much honour, I'm sure) I say then,
not expecting your return, or hoping ever to see you
again, I have delivered your jewels to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Whom?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> My husband.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Your husband!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, my husband. For since you could leave me,
I am lately and privately married to one, who is a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
so much honour and experience in the world, that I dare
not ask him for your jewels again to restore 'em to you;
lest he should conclude you never would have parted
with 'em to me on any other score but the exchange of
my honour: which rather than you'd let me lose, you'd
lose I'm sure yourself, those trifles of yours.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Triumphant impudence! but married too!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, speak not so loud, my servants know it not:
I am married, there's no resisting one's destiny or love,
you know.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, did you love him too?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Most passionately; nay, love him now, though I
have married him, and he me: which mutual love I hope
you are too good, too generous a man to disturb, by any
future claim, or visits to me. 'Tis true, he is now absent
in the country, but returns shortly; therefore I beg of you,
for your own ease and quiet, and my honour, you will
never see me more.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I wish I never had seen you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But if you should ever have anything to say to
me hereafter, let that young gentleman there be your
messenger.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You would be kinder to him; I find he should
be welcome.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Alas! his youth would keep my husband from
suspicions, and his visits from scandal; for we women
may have pity for such as he, but no love: and I already
think you do not well to spirit him away to sea; and the
sea is already but too rich with the spoils of the shore.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> True perfect woman! If I could say anything
more injurious to her now, I would; for I could
outrail a bilked whore, or a kicked coward; but now
I think on't, that were rather to discover my love than
hatred; and I must not talk, for something I must do.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I think I have given him enough of me now, never
to be troubled with him again. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p>

<p>Well, Lettice, are the cards and all ready within? I come
then.&mdash;Captain, I beg your pardon: you will not make
one at ombre?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, madam, but I'll wish you a little good luck
before you go.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, if you would have me thrive, curse me: for
that you'll do heartily, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then if you will have it so, may all the curses
light upon you, women ought to fear, and you deserve!&mdash;First,
may the curse of loving play attend your sordid
covetousness, and fortune cheat you, by trusting to her,
as you have cheated me; the curse of pride, or a good
reputation, fall on your lust; the curse of affectation on
your beauty; the curse of your husband's company on
your pleasures; and the curse of your gallant's disappointments
in his absence; and the curse of scorn,
jealousy, or despair on your love; and then the curse of
loving on!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And to requite all your curses, I will only return
you your last; may the curse of loving me still fall upon
your proud hard heart, that could be so cruel to me in
these horrid curses! but heaven forgive you! [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hell and the devil reward thee!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, you see now, mistresses, like friends, are
lost by letting 'em handle your money; and most
women are such kind of witches, who can have no
power over a man, unless you give 'em money: but
when once they have got any from you, they never leave
you till they have all. Therefore I never give a woman
a farthing.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, there is yet this comfort by losing one's
money with one's mistress, a man is out of danger of
getting another; of being made prize again by love, who,
like a pirate, takes you by spreading false colours: but
when once you have run your ship a-ground, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>

where is my paper of memorandums? Give me, child:
so. Where is my cousin Olivia now, my kind relation?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Here is one that would be your kind relation,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What mean you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, faith, (to be short) to marry you, widow.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Is not this the wild rude person we saw at
Captain Manly's?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, forsooth, an't please.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What would you? what are you? Marry me!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, faith; for I am a younger brother, and you
are a widow.</p>

your business.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I have none, but to marry thee, widow.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But I have other business, I'd have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But you have no business a-nights, widow; and
I'll make you pleasanter business than any you have.
For a-nights, I assure you, I am a man of great business;
for the business&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Go, I'm sure you're an idle fellow.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Try me but, widow, and employ me as you find
my abilities and industry.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Pray be civil to the lady, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;she is a person
of quality, a person that is no person&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Yes, but she's a person that is a widow. Be you
mannerly to her, because you are to pretend only to be
her squire, to arm her to her lawyer's chambers; but I
will be impudent and bawdy; for she must love and
marry me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Marry come up, you saucy familiar Jack! You
think, with us widows, 'tis no more than up, and ride.
Gad forgive me! now-a-days, every idle, young, hectoring,
roaring companion, with a pair of turned red breeches,
and a broad back, thinks to carry away any widow of the
best degree. But I'd have you to know, sir, all widows
are not got, like places at court, by impudence and importunity
only.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> No, no, soft, soft, you are a young man, and not
fit&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> For a widow? yes sure, old man, the fitter.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Go to, go to; if others had not laid in their
claims before you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Not you, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Why not I, sir? sure I am a much more proportionable
match for her than you, sir; I, who am an elder
brother, of a comfortable fortune, and of equal years with
her.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How's that, you unmannerly person? I'd have
you to know, I was born but in <i>Ann' undec' Caroli
prim'</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Your pardon, lady, your pardon: be not offended
with your very humble servant&mdash;But, I say, sir, you are
a beggarly younger brother, twenty years younger than
her, without any land or stock, but your great stock of
impudence: therefore what pretension can you have to
her?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> You have made it for me: first, because I am a
younger brother.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Why, is that a sufficient plea to a relict? how
appears it, sir? by what foolish custom?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> By custom time out of mind only. Then, sir,
because I have nothing to keep me after her death, I am
the likelier to take care of her life. And for my being
twenty years younger than her, and having a sufficient
stock of impudence, I leave it to her whether they will be
valid exceptions to me in her widow's law or equity.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Well, she has been so long in chancery, that I'll
stand to her equity and decree between us. Come, lady,

is, with all the ill-breeding imaginable.&mdash;[<i>Aside to</i> Widow

wouldst fall asunder, if 'twere not for thy cerecloths&mdash;</p>

man love thee now, without dissembling.</p>

feeble, paralytic, impotent, fumbling, frigid nincompoop!</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Hey, brave mother, for calling of names, i'fac!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Wouldst thou make a caudle-maker, a nurse of
me? can't you be bedrid without a bed-fellow? won't
your swan-skins, furs, flannels, and the scorched trencher,
keep you warm there? would you have me your Scotch
warming-pan,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> with a pox to you! me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> O Heavens!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I told you I should be thought the fitter man,
major.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, you old fobus, and you would have been my
guardian, would you, to have taken care of my estate,
that half of't should never come to me, by letting long
leases at pepper-corn rents?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> If I would have married an old man, 'tis well
known I might have married an earl, nay, what's more, a
judge, and been covered the winter nights with the lambskins,
which I prefer to the ermines of nobles. And
dost thou think I would wrong my poor minor there for
you?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Your minor is a chopping minor, God bless him!
[<i>Strokes</i> <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> <i>on the head.</i></p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Your minor may be a major of horse or foot, for
his bigness; and it seems you will have the cheating of
your minor to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Pray, sir, bear witness:&mdash;cheat my minor! I'll
bring my action of the case for the slander.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, I would bear false witness for thee now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
widow, since you have done me justice, and have thought
me the fitter man for you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Fair and softly, sir, 'tis my minor's case, more
than my own; and I must do him justice now on you.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> So then.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> You are, first, (I warrant,) some renegado from
the inns of court and the law; and thou'lt come to suffer
for't by the law, that is, be hanged.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Not about your neck, forsooth, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But, madam&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Hear the court.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Thou art some debauched, drunken, lewd,
hectoring, gaming companion, and wantest some widow's
old gold to nick<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> upon; but I thank you, sir, that's for
my lawyers.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Faith, we should ne'er quarrel about that; for
guineas would serve my turn.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> But, widow&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Thou art a foul-mouthed boaster of thy lust, a
mere bragadochio of thy strength for wine and women,
and wilt belie thyself more than thou dost women, and
art every way a base deceiver of women; and would
deceive me too, would you?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, faith, widow, this is judging without seeing
the evidence.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I say, you are a worn-out whoremaster at five-and-twenty,
both in body and fortune, and cannot be
trusted by the common wenches of the town, lest you
should not pay 'em; nor by the wives of the town lest
you should pay 'em: so you want women, and would
have me your bawd to procure 'em for you.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Faith, if you had any good acquaintance, widow,
'twould be civilly done of thee; for I am just come from
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I mean, you would have me keep you, that you
might turn keeper; for poor widows are only used like
bawds by you; you go to church with us, but to get other
women to lie with. In fine, you are a cheating, cozening
spendthrift; and having sold your own annuity, would
waste my jointure.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> And make havoc of our estate personal, and all
our gilt plate; I should soon be piling up all our
mortgaged apostle-spoons, bowls, and beakers, out of
most of the ale-houses betwixt Hercules-pillars<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and the
Boatswain in Wapping; nay, and you'd be scouring
amongst my trees, and make 'em knock down one
another, like routed reeling watchmen at midnight;
would you so, bully?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, prithee, widow, hear me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, sir; I'd have you to know, thou pitiful,
paltry, lath-backed fellow, if I would have married a
young man, 'tis well known I could have had any young
heir in Norfolk, nay, the hopefullest young man this day
at the King's-bench bar; I that am a relict and executrix
of known plentiful assets and parts, who understand
myself and the law. And would you have me under
covert-baron<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> again? No, sir, no covert-baron for me.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But, dear widow, hear me. I value you only,
not your jointure.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, sir, hold there; I know your love to a
widow is covetousness of her jointure: and a widow, a
little stricken in years, with a good jointure, is like an old
mansion-house in a good purchase, never valued, but
take one, take t'other: and perhaps, when you are in
possession, you'd neglect it, let it drop to the ground, for
want of necessary repairs or expenses upon't.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No, widow, one would be sure to keep all tight,
when one is to forfeit one's lease by dilapidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Fy! fy! I neglect my business with this foolish
discourse of love. Jerry, child, let me see the list of the
jury: I'm sure my cousin Olivia has some relations
amongst them. But where is she?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, widow, but hear me one word only.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, sir, no more, pray. I will no more hearken
to your foolish love-motions, than to offers of arbitration.
[<i>Exeunt</i> Widow <span class="smcap">Blackacre</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, I'll follow thee yet; for he that has a
pretension at court, or to a widow, must never give over
for a little ill-usage.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Therefore, I'll get her by assiduity, patience, and
long sufferings, which you will not undergo; for you
idle young fellows leave off love when it comes to be
business; and industry gets more women than love.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, industry, the fool's and old man's merit.&mdash;But
I'll be industrious too, and make a business on't, and
get her by law, wrangling, and contests, and not by
sufferings: and, because you are no dangerous rival, I'll
give thee counsel, major:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If you litigious widow e'er would gain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sigh not to her, but by the law complain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To her, as to a bawd, defendant sue</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Westminster Hall.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>, <i>two</i> Sailors <i>behind.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I hate this place worse than a man
that has inherited a chancery suit: I
wish I were well out on't again.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, you need not be afraid
of this place: for a man without
money needs no more fear a crowd
of lawyers than a crowd of pickpockets.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> This, the reverend of the law would have
thought the palace or residence of Justice; but, if it be,
she lives here with the state of a Turkish emperor, rarely
seen; and besieged rather than defended by her numerous
black-guard here.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Methinks 'tis like one of their own halls in
Christmas time, whither from all parts fools bring their
money, to try by the dice (not the worst judges) whether
it shall be their own or no: but after a tedious fretting
and wrangling, they drop away all their money on both
sides; and, finding neither the better, at last go emptily
and lovingly away together to the tavern, joining their
curses against the young lawyer's box, that sweeps all,
like the old ones.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Spoken like a revelling Christmas lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Yes, I was one, I confess, but was fain to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
the law, out of conscience, and fall to making false
musters: rather choose to cheat the king than his subjects;
plunder rather than take fees.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, a plague and a purse-famine light on the
law; and that female limb of it who dragged me hither
to-day! But prithee go see if, in that crowd of daggled
gowns there, [<i>Pointing to a crowd of</i> Lawyers <i>at the end of
the stage</i>,] thou canst find her. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How hard it is to be a hypocrite!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At least to me, who am but newly so.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I thought it once a kind of knavery,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, cowardice, to hide one's fault; but now</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The common frailty, love, becomes my shame.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He must not know I love the ungrateful still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest he contemn me more than she; for I,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It seems, can undergo a woman's scorn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But not a man's&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Sir, good sir, generous captain.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Prithee, kind impertinence, leave me. Why
should'st thou follow me, flatter my generosity now, since
thou knowest I have no money left? if I had it, I'd give
it thee, to buy my quiet.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I never followed yet, sir, reward or fame, but you
alone; nor do I now beg anything but leave to share
your miseries. You should not be a niggard of 'em,
since, methinks, you have enough to spare. Let me
follow you now, because you hate me, as you have often
said.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I ever hated a coward's company, I must
confess.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Let me follow you till I am none, then; for you,
I'm sure, will go through such worlds of dangers, that,
I shall be inured to 'em; nay, I shall be afraid of your
anger more than danger, and so turn valiant out of fear.
Dear captain, do not cast me off till you have tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
me once more: do not, do not go to sea again without
me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou to sea! to court, thou fool; remember
the advice I gave thee: thou art a handsome spaniel, and
canst fawn naturally: go, busk about and run thyself into
the next great man's lobby; first fawn upon the slaves
without, and then run into the lady's bedchamber; thou
mayst be admitted at last to tumble her bed. Go seek,
I say, and lose me; for I am not able to keep thee; I
have not bread for myself.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Therefore I will not go, because then I may help
and serve you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I warrant you, sir; for, at worst, I could beg or
steal for you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, more bragging! Dost thou not know
there's venturing your life in stealing? Go, prithee,
away: thou art as hard to shake off as that flattering,
effeminating mischief, love.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Love did you name? Why, you are not so
miserable as to be yet in love, sure?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, no, prithee away, begone, or&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I
had almost discovered my love and shame; well, if I
had, that thing could not think the worse of me&mdash;or if
he did&mdash;no&mdash;yes, he shall know it&mdash;he shall&mdash;but then I
must never leave him, for they are such secrets, that
make parasites and pimps lords of their masters: for any
slavery or tyranny is easier than love's.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come
hither, since thou art so forward to serve me: hast thou
but resolution enough to endure the torture of a secret?
for such to some is insupportable.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I would keep it as safe as if your dear, precious
life depended on't.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn your dearness! It concerns more than
my life,&mdash;my honour.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Doubt it not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And do not discover it, by too much fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
discovering it; but have a great care you let not Freeman
find it out.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I warrant you, sir, I am already all joy with the
hopes of your commands; and shall be all wings in the
execution of 'em: speak quickly, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You said you'd beg for me.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I did, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then you shall beg for me.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> With all my heart, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That is, pimp for me.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> How, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> D'ye start! Thinkest thou, thou couldst do me
any other service? Come, no dissembling honour: I
know you can do it handsomely, thou wert made for't.
You have lost your time with me at sea, you must recover
it.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Do not, sir, beget yourself more reasons for your
aversion to me, and make my obedience to you a fault;
I am the unfittest in the world to do you such a service.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Your cunning arguing against it shows but how
fit you are for it. No more dissembling; here, I say,
you must go use it for me to Olivia.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> To her, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Go flatter, lie, kneel, promise, anything to get
her for me: I cannot live unless I have her. Didst thou
not say thou wouldst do anything to save my life? and
she said you had a persuading face.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But did you not say, sir, your honour was dearer
to you than your life? and would you have me contribute
to the loss of that, and carry love from you to the
most infamous, most false, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And most beautiful!&mdash;[<i>Sighs aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Most ungrateful woman that ever lived; for sure
she must be so, that could desert you so soon, use you
so basely, and so lately too: do not, do not forget it,
sir, and think&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, I will not forget it, but think of revenge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
I will lie with her out of revenge. Go, begone, and prevail
for me, or never see me more.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> You scorned her last night.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I know not what I did last night; I dissembled
last night.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Heavens!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Begone, I say, and bring me love or compliance
back, or hopes at least, or I'll never see thy face again,
by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> O, do not swear, sir! first hear me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I'm impatient, away! you'll find me here till
twelve. [<i>Turns away.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Sir&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not one word; no insinuating argument more,
or soothing persuasion; you'll have need of all your
rhetoric with her; go strive to alter her, not me; begone.
[<i>Retires to the end of the stage, and exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Widow <span class="smcap">Blackacre</span>, <i>in the middle of half-a-dozen</i>
Lawyers, <i>whispered to by a fellow in black</i>, <span class="smcap">Jerry
Blackacre</span> <i>following the crowd.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Offer me a reference, you saucy companion you!
d'ye know who you speak to? Art thou a solicitor in
chancery, and offer a reference? A pretty fellow! Mr.
Serjeant Ploddon, here's a fellow has the impudence to
offer me a reference!</p>

<p><i>Serj. Plod.</i> Who's that has the impudence to offer a
reference within these walls?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, for a splitter of causes to do't!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Serj. Plod.</i> No, madam; to a lady learned in the law,
as you are, the offer of a reference were to impose upon
you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, no, never fear me for a reference, Mr.
Serjeant. But come, have you not forgot your brief?
Are you sure you shan't make the mistake of&mdash;hark you&mdash;[<i>Whispers.</i>]
Go then, go to your court of Common-pleas,
and say one thing over and over again: you do it
so naturally, you'll never be suspected for protracting
time.</p>

<p><i>Serj. Plod.</i> Come, I know the course of the court, and
your business. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Let's see, Jerry, where are my minutes? Come,
Mr. Quaint, pray go talk a great deal for me in chancery,
let your words be easy, and your sense hard; my cause
requires it: branch it bravely, and deck my cause with
flowers, that the snake may lie hidden. Go, go, and be
sure you remember the decree of my Lord Chancellor,
<i>Tricesimo quart'</i> of the queen.</p>

<p><i>Quaint.</i> I will, as I see cause, extenuate or examplify
matter of fact; baffle truth with impudence; answer
exceptions with questions, though never so impertinent;
for reasons give 'em words; for law and equity, tropes
and figures; and so relax and enervate the sinews of
their argument with the oil of my eloquence. But when
my lungs can reason no longer, and not being able to
say anything more for our cause, say everything of our
adversary; whose reputation, though never so clear and
evident in the eye of the world, yet with sharp invectives&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Alias, Billingsgate.</p>

<p><i>Quaint.</i> With poignant and sour invectives, I say, I
will deface, wipe out, and obliterate his fair reputation,
even as a record with the juice of lemons; and tell such a
story, (for the truth on't is, all that we can do for our
client in chancery, is telling a story,) a fine story, a long
story, such a story&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Go, save thy breath for the cause; talk at the
bar, Mr. Quaint: you are so copiously fluent, you can
weary any one's ears sooner than your own tongue. Go,
weary our adversaries' counsel, and the court; go, thou
art a fine-spoken person: adad, I shall make thy wife
jealous of me, if you can but court the court into a
decree for us. Go, get you gone, and
remember&mdash;[Whispers.]&mdash;[Exit <span class="smcap">Quaint</span>.]&mdash;Come, Mr. Blunder, pray
bawl soundly for me, at the King's-bench, bluster, sputter,
question, cavil; but be sure your argument be intricate
enough to confound the court; and then you do my
business. Talk what you will, but be sure your tongue
never stand still; for your own noise will secure your
sense from censure: 'tis like coughing or hemming when
one has got the belly-ache, which stifles the unmannerly
noise. Go, dear rogue, and succeed; and I'll invite thee,
ere it be long, to more soused venison.</p>

<p><i>Blund.</i> I'll warrant you, after your verdict, your judgment
shall not be arrested upon if's and and's. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Come, Mr. Petulant, let me give you some new
instructions for our cause in the Exchequer. Are the
barons sat?</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Yes, no; may be they are, may be they are not:
what know I? what care I?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Heyday! I wish you would but snap up the
counsel on t'other side anon at the bar as much; and
have a little more patience with me, that I might instruct
you a little better.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> You instruct me! what is my brief for, mistress?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ay, but you seldom read your brief but at the
bar, if you do it then.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Perhaps I do, perhaps I don't, and perhaps 'tis
time enough: pray hold yourself contented, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, if you go there too, I will not be contented,
sir; though you, I see, will lose my cause for want of
speaking, I wo' not: you shall hear me, and shall be instructed.
Let's see your brief.</p>

I'd have you to know, I do not wear a bar-gown&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> By a woman! and I'd have you to know, I am no
common woman; but a woman conversant in the laws of
the land, as well as yourself, though I have no bar-gown.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Go to, go to, mistress, you are impertinent, and
there's your brief for you: instruct me!
[<i>Flings her breviate at her.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Impertinent to me, you saucy Jack, you! you
return my breviate, but where's my fee? you'll be sure to
keep that, and scan that so well, that if there chance to be
but a brass half-crown in't, one's sure to hear on't again:
would you would but look on your breviate half so narrowly!
But pray give me my fee too, as well as my brief.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Mistress, that's without precedent. When did a
counsel ever return his fee, pray? and you are impertinent
and ignorant to demand it.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Impertinent again, and ignorant, to me! Gads-bodikins,
you puny upstart in the law, to use me so! you
green-bag carrier, you murderer of unfortunate causes, the
clerk's ink is scarce off of your fingers,&mdash;you that newly
come from lamp-blacking the judges' shoes, and are not
fit to wipe mine; you call me impertinent and ignorant!
I would give thee a cuff on the ear, sitting the courts, if
I were ignorant. Marry-gep, if it had not been for me,
thou hadst been yet but a hearing counsel at the bar.

<p><i>But.</i> Away, away! pray be not so troublesome, mistress:
I must be gone.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, but consider a little: I am your old client,
my lord but a new one; or let him be what he will, he
will hardly be a better client to you than myself: I hope
you believe I shall be in law as long as I live; therefore
am no despicable client. Well, but go to your lord; I
know you expect he should make you a judge one day;
but I hope his promise to you will prove a true lord's
promise. But that he might be sure to fail you, I wish
you had his bond for't.</p>

<p><i>But.</i> But what, will you yet be thus impertinent,
mistress?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, I beseech you, sir, stay; if it be but to tell
me my lord's case; come, in short&mdash;</p>

<p><i>But.</i> Nay, then&mdash;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well, Jerry, observe child, and lay it up for
hereafter. These are those lawyers who, by being in all
causes, are in none: therefore if you would have 'em for
you, let your adversary fee 'em; for he may chance to
depend upon 'em; and so, in being against thee, they'll
be for thee.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, mother; they put me in mind of the unconscionable
wooers of widows, who undertake briskly their
matrimonial business for their money; but when they
have got it once, let who will drudge for them. Therefore
have a care of 'em, forsooth. There's advice for
your advice.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well said, boy.&mdash;Come, Mr. Splitcause, pray go
see when my cause in Chancery comes on; and go speak
with Mr. Quillit in the King's-bench, and Mr. Quirk in
the Common-pleas, and see how matters go there.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Lady, a good and propitious morning to you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
and may all your causes go as well as if I myself were
judge of 'em!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Sir, excuse me; I am busy, and cannot answer
compliments in Westminster Hall.&mdash;Go, Mr. Splitcause,
and come to me again to that bookseller's; there I'll
stay for you, that you may be sure to find me.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> No, sir, come to the other bookseller's. I'll
attend your ladyship thither. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Splitcause</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Why to the other?</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Because he is my bookseller, lady.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What, to sell you lozenges for your catarrh? or
medicines for your corns? What else can a major deal
with a bookseller for?</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Lady, he prints for me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Why, are you an author?</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Of some few essays; deign you, lady, to peruse
'em.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] She is a woman of parts; and I must win
her by showing mine.</p>

<p><i>Bookseller's Boy.</i> Will you see Culpepper, mistress?
"Aristotle's Problems?" "The Complete Midwife?"</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No; let's see Dalton, Hughs, Shepherd, Wingate.</p>

<p><i>B. Boy.</i> We have no law books.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No! you are a pretty bookseller then.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Come, have you e'er a one of my essays left?</p>

<p><i>B. Boy.</i> Yes, sir, we have enough, and shall always
have 'em.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>B. Boy.</i> Why, they are good, steady, lasting ware.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Nay, I hope they will live; let's see.&mdash;Be pleased,
madam, to peruse the poor endeavours of my pen: for I
have a pen, though I say it, that&mdash;[<i>Gives her a book.</i></p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Pray let me see "St. George for Christendom,"
or, "The Seven Champions of England."</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, no; give him "The Young Clerk's Guide."&mdash;What,
we shall have you read yourself into a humour
of rambling and fighting, and studying military discipline,
and wearing red breeches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Nay, if you talk of military discipline, show him
my "Treatise of the Art Military."</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Hold; I would as willingly he should read a
play.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> O, pray forsooth, mother, let me have a play.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, sirrah; there are young students of the law
enough spoiled already by plays. They would make you
in love with your laundress, or, what's worse, some queen
of the stage that was a laundress; and so turn keeper before
you are of age. [<i>Several cross the stage.</i>] But stay, Jerry,
is not that Mr. What d'ye-call-him, that goes there, he
that offered to sell me a suit in chancery for five hundred
pounds, for a hundred down, and only paying the clerk's
fees?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, forsooth, 'tis he.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Then stay here, and have a care of the bags,
whilst I follow him.&mdash;Have a care of the bags, I say.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> And do you have a care, forsooth, of the statute
against champarty,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> I say. [<i>Exit</i> Widow <span class="smcap">Blackacre</span>.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So, there's a limb of my widow, which
was wont to be inseparable from her: she can't be far.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
How now, my pretty son-in-law that shall be,
where's my widow?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> My mother, but not your widow, will be forthcoming
presently.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Your servant, major. What, are you buying
furniture for a little sleeping closet, which you miscall a
study? For you do only by your books, as by your
wenches, bind 'em up neatly and make 'em fine, for other
people to use 'em. And your bookseller is properly your
upholsterer, for he furnishes your room, rather than your
head.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Well, well, good sea-lieutenant, study you your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
compass; that's more than your head can deal with.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I will go find out the widow, to keep her out of
his sight, or he'll board her, whilst I am treating a peace.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Nay, prithee, friend, now let me have but "The
Seven Champions." You shall trust me no longer than
till my mother's Mr. Splitcause comes; for I hope he'll
lend me wherewithal to pay for't.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Lend thee! here, I'll pay him. Do you want
money, squire? I'm sorry a man of your estate should
want money.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Nay, my mother will ne'er let me be at age: and
till then, she says&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> At age! why you are at age already to have
spent an estate, man. There are younger than you have
kept their women these three years, have had half a
dozen claps, and lost as many thousand pounds at play.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, they are happy sparks! Nay, I know some
of my schoolfellows, who, when we were at school, were
two years younger than me; but now, I know not how,
are grown men before me, and go where they will, and
look to themselves. But my curmudgeonly mother won't
allow me wherewithal to be a man of myself with.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, there 'tis; I knew your mother was in
fault. Ask but your schoolfellows what they did to be
men of themselves.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Why, I know they went to law with their mothers:
for they say, there's no good to be done upon a widow
mother, till one goes to law with her; but mine is as
plaguy a lawyer as any's of our inn. Then would she
marry too, and cut down my trees. Now, I should hate,
man, to have my father's wife kissed and slapped, and
t'other thing too, (you know what I mean,) by another
man: and our trees are the purest, tall, even, shady
twigs, by my fa&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Come, squire, let your mother and your trees
fall as she pleases, rather than wear this gown and carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
green bags all thy life, and be pointed at for a Tony.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
But you shall be able to deal with her yet the common
way. Thou shalt make false love to some lawyer's
daughter, whose father, upon the hopes of thy marrying
her, shall lend thee money and law to preserve thy
estate and trees: and thy mother is so ugly nobody will
have her, if she cannot cut down thy trees.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Nay, if I had but anybody to stand by me, I am
as stomachful as another.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> That will I: I'll not see any hopeful young
gentleman abused.</p>

<p><i>B. Boy.</i> By any but yourself. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> The truth on't is, mine's as arrant a widow-mother
to her poor child as any's in England. She won't so
much as let one have sixpence in one's pocket to see a
motion,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> or the dancing of the ropes, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Come, you shan't want money; there's gold for
you.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> O lord, sir, two guineas! D'ye lend me this? Is
there no trick in't? Well, sir, I'll give you my bond for
security.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No, no; thou hast given me thy face for
security: anybody would swear thou dost not look like a
cheat. You shall have what you will of me; and if your
mother will not be kinder to you, come to me, who will.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] By my fa&mdash;he's a curious fine
gentleman!&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] But will you stand by one?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> If you can be resolute.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Can be resolved! Gad, if she gives me but a
cross word, I'll leave her to-night, and come to you. But
now I have got money, I'll go to Jack-of-all-Trades, at
t'other end of the Hall, and buy the neatest purest
things&mdash;</p>

which you are like enough to do, if it be, as you say, an
honest one: I will suffer no longer for't.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, captain, I tell you, you are my prime witness;
and the cause is just now coming on, Mr. Splitcause
tells me. Lord, methinks you should take a pleasure in
walking here, as half you see now do; for they have no
business here, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes; but I'll assure you then, their business is
to persecute me. But d'ye think I'll stay any longer, to
have a rogue, because he knows my name, pluck me aside
and whisper a news-book secret to me with a stinking
breath? a second come piping angry from the court, and
sputter in my face his tedious complaints against it? a
third law-coxcomb, because he saw me once at a reader's
dinner, come and put me a long law case, to make a
discovery of his indefatigable dulness and my wearied
patience? a fourth, a most barbarous civil rogue, who
will keep a man half an hour in the crowd with a bowed
body, and a hat off, acting the reformed sign of the Salutation
tavern, to hear his bountiful professions of service and
friendship, whilst he cares not if I were damned, and I
am wishing him hanged out of my way?&mdash;I'd as soon run
the gauntlet, as walk t'other turn.</p>

trangames, which thou hast stolen or purloined; for
nobody would trust a minor in Westminster Hall, sure.</p>

commodities by a fair bargain and sale; and there stands
my witness and creditor.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You can tell her, Freeman, I suppose.

They are all that concern my estate, my jointure,
my husband's deed of gift, my evidences for all my suits
now depending! What will become of them?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I'm glad to hear this.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] They'll
be all safe, I warrant you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O where? where? Come, you villain, along
with me, and show me where.
[<i>Exeunt</i> Widow <span class="smcap">Blackacre, Jerry</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Oldfox</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou hast taken the right way to get a widow,
by making her great boy rebel; for when nothing will
make a widow marry, she'll do it to cross her children.
But canst thou in earnest marry this harpy, this volume
of shrivelled blurred parchments and law, this attorney's
desk?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, ay; I'll marry and live honestly, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
give my creditors, not her, due benevolence,&mdash;pay my
debts.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thy creditors, you see, are not so barbarous as
to put thee in prison; and wilt thou commit thyself to a
noisome dungeon for thy life? which is the only satisfaction
thou canst give thy creditors by this match.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, is not she rich?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay; but he that marries a widow for her money,
will find himself as much mistaken as the widow that
marries a young fellow for due benevolence, as you call it.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, d'ye think I shan't deserve wages? I'll
drudge faithfully.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I tell thee again, he that is the slave in the mine
has the least propriety in the ore. You may dig, and dig;
but if thou wouldst have her money, rather get to be her
trustee than her husband; for a true widow will make
over her estate to anybody, and cheat herself rather than
be cheated by her children or a second husband.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Gone to drown or hang himself.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, I know him too well; he'll ne'er be <i>felo de

own head, and so be <i>felo de ses biens</i>; for he has not yet
chosen one.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Say you so? And he shan't want one. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But, now I think on't, 'tis you, sir, have put this
cheat upon me; for there is a saying, "Take hold of a
maid by her smock, and a widow by her writings, and
they cannot get from you." But I'll play fast and loose
with you yet, if there be law, and my minor and writings
are not forthcoming; I'll bring my action of detinue or
trover. But first, I'll try to find out this guardianless,
graceless villain.&mdash;Will you jog, major?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> If you have lost your evidence, I hope your

<p><i>Free.</i> Well; sure I am the first man that ever began a
love-intrigue in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, sure; for the love to a widow generally
begins here: and as the widow's cause goes against the
heir or executors, the jointure-rivals commence their suit
to the widow.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well; but how, pray, have you passed your time
here, since I was forced to leave you alone? You have
had a great deal of patience.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Is this a place to be alone, or have patience in?
But I have had patience, indeed; for I have drawn upon
me, since I came, but three quarrels and two lawsuits.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, faith, you are too curst to be let loose in
the world: you should be tied up again in your sea-kennel,
called a ship. But how could you quarrel here?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How could I refrain? A lawyer talked peremptorily
and saucily to me, and as good as gave me the lie.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> They do it so often to one another at the bar,
that they make no bones on't elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> However, I gave him a cuff on the ear; whereupon
he jogs two men, whose backs were turned to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
(for they were reading at a bookseller's,) to witness I
struck him, sitting the courts; which office they so readily
promised, that I called 'em rascals and knights of the
post.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> One of 'em presently calls two other absent witnesses,
who were coming towards us at a distance; whilst
the other, with a whisper, desires to know my name, that
he might have satisfaction by way of challenge, as t'other
by way of writ; but if it were not rather to direct his
brother's writ, than his own challenge.&mdash;There, you see,
is one of my quarrels, and two of my lawsuits.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> So!&mdash;and the other two?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> For advising a poet to leave off writing, and
turn lawyer, because he is dull and impudent, and says or
writes nothing now but by precedent.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And the third quarrel?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> For giving more sincere advice to a handsome,
well-dressed young fellow, (who asked it too,) not to
marry a wench that he loved, and I had lain with.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, if you will be giving your sincere advice to
lovers and poets, you will not fail of quarrels.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Or if I stay in this place; for I see more quarrels
crowding upon me. Let's be gone, and avoid 'em.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To what purpose, since here comes another as

<p><i>Old.</i> Your servant, worthy, noble captain. Well, I
have left the widow, because she carried me from your
company: for, faith, captain, I must needs tell thee thou
art the only officer in England, who was not an Edgehill
officer, that I care for.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I'm sorry for't.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Why, wouldst thou have me love them?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Anybody rather than me.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> What! you are modest, I see; therefore, too, I
love thee.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, I am not modest; but love to brag myself,
and can't patiently hear you fight over the last civil war.
Therefore, go look out the fellow I saw just now here,
that walks with his sword and stockings out at heels, and
let him tell you the history of that scar on his cheek, to
give you occasion to show yours got in the field at
Bloomsbury, not that of Edgehill. Go to him, poor
fellow; he is fasting, and has not yet the happiness this
morning to stink of brandy and tobacco: go, give him
some to hear you; I am busy.</p>

thou art peevish, and fretting at some ill success at law.
Prithee, tell me what ill luck you have met with here.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Do I look like the picture of ill luck? gadsnouns,
I love thee more and more. And shall I tell thee what
made me love thee first?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Do; that I may be rid of that damned quality
and thee.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> 'Twas thy wearing that broad sword there.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Here, Freeman, let's change: I'll never wear it
more.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> How! you won't, sure. Prithee, don't look like
one of our holiday captains now-a-days, with a bodkin by
your side, your martinet rogues.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O, then, there's hopes.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] What,
d'ye find fault with martinet? Let me tell you, sir, 'tis
the best exercise in the world; the most ready, most easy,
most graceful exercise that ever was used, and the most&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Nay, nay, sir, no more; sir, your servant: if you
praise martinet once, I have done with you, sir.&mdash;Martinet!
martinet!&mdash;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, you have made him leave you as willingly
as ever he did an enemy; for he was truly for the king
and parliament: for the parliament in their list; and for
the king in cheating 'em of their pay, and never hurting
the king's party in the field.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a</i> Lawyer <i>towards them.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> A pox! this way:&mdash;here's a lawyer I know
threatening us with another greeting.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Sir, sir, your very servant; I was afraid you had
forgotten me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I was not afraid you had forgotten me.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> No, sir; we lawyers have pretty good memories.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You ought to have by your wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Law.</i> O, you are a merry gentleman, sir: I remember
you were merry when I was last in your company.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I was never merry in thy company, Mr. Lawyer,
sure.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Why, I'm sure you joked upon me, and shammed
me all night long.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Shammed! prithee what barbarous law-term is
that?</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Shamming! why, don't you know that? 'tis all
our way of wit, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I am glad I do not know it then. Shamming!
what does he mean by't, Freeman!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Shamming is telling you an insipid dull lie with
a dull face, which the sly wag the author only laughs at
himself; and making himself believe 'tis a good jest, puts
the sham only upon himself.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> So, your lawyer's jest, I find, like his practice,
has more knavery than wit in't. I should make the worst
shammer in England: I must always deal ingenuously,
as I will with you, Mr. Lawyer, and advise you to be
seen rather with attorneys and solicitors, than such fellows
as I am: they will credit your practice more.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> No, sir, your company's an honour to me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, faith; go this way, there goes an attorney;
leave me for him; let it never be said a lawyer's civility
did him hurt.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> No, worthy, honoured sir; I'll not leave you for
any attorney, sure.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Unless he had a fee in his hand.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Have you any business here, sir? Try me: I'd
serve you sooner than any attorney breathing.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Business&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] So, I have thought of a sure
way.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Yes, faith, I have a little business.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Have you so, sir? in what court, sir? what is't,
sir? Tell me but how I may serve you, and I'll do't, sir,
and take it for as great an honour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Faith, 'tis for a poor orphan of a sea officer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
mine, that has no money. But if it could be followed in
<i>forma pauperis</i>, and when the legacy's recovered&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Law. Forma pauperis</i>, sir!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, sir. [<i>Several crossing the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Law.</i> Mr. Bumblecase, Mr. Bumblecase! a word with
you.&mdash;Sir, I beg your pardon at present; I have a little
business&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Which is not in <i>forma pauperis</i>. [<i>Exit</i> Lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> So, you have now found a way to be rid of people
without quarrelling?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Alderman.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But here's a city-rogue will stick as hard upon
us, as if I owed him money.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Captain, noble sir, I am yours heartily, d'ye see;
why should you avoid your old friends?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And why should you follow me? I owe you
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Out of my hearty respects to you: for there is
not a man in England&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou wouldst save from hanging with the expense
of a shilling only.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Nay, nay, but, captain, you are like enough to
tell me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Truth, which you won't care to hear; therefore
you had better go talk with somebody else.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> No, I know nobody can inform me better of some
young wit, or spendthrift, that has a good dipped<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> seat

any of these would serve my turn: now, if you knew of
such a one, and would but help&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> I'faith, you should have a snip&mdash;</p>

would you make me your squire setter, your bawd for
manors? [<i>Takes him by the nose.</i></p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Oh!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Hold, or here will be your third law-suit.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Gads-precious, you hectoring person you, are you
wild? I meant you no hurt, sir: I begin to think, as
things go, land-security best, and have for a convenient
mortgage, some ten, fifteen or twenty thousand pound by
me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then go lay it out upon an hospital, and take a
mortgage of Heaven, according to your city custom; for
you think by laying out a little money to hook in that too
hereafter. Do, I say, and keep the poor you've made by
taking forfeitures, that Heaven may not take yours.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> No, to keep the cripples you make this war.
This war spoils our trade.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn your trade! 'tis the better for't.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> What, will you speak against our trade?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And dare you speak against the war, our trade?</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, he may be a convoy of ships I am
concerned in.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Come, captain, I will have a fair
correspondence with you, say what you will.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then prithee be gone.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> No, faith; prithee, captain, let's go drink a dish
of laced coffee,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and talk of the times. Come, I'll treat
you: nay, you shall go, for I have no business here.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But I have.</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> To pick up a man to give thee a dinner. Come,
I'll do thy business for thee.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Faith, now I think on't, so you may, as well as
any man: for 'tis to pick up a man to be bound with me,
to one who expects city security for&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Nay, then your servant, captain; business must
be done.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, if it can. But hark you, alderman, without
you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ald.</i> Business, sir, I say, must be done; and there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
an officer of the treasury [<i>Several cross the stage.</i>] I have
an affair with&mdash;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> You see now what the mighty friendship of the
world is; what all ceremony, embraces, and plentiful
professions come to! You are no more to believe a professing
friend than a threatening enemy; and as no man
hurts you, that tells you he'll do you a mischief, no man,
you see, is your servant who says he is so. Why the
devil, then, should a man be troubled with the flattery of
knaves if he be not a fool or cully; or with the fondness
of fools, if he be not a knave or cheat?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Only for his pleasure: for there is some in laughing
at fools, and disappointing knaves.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> That's a pleasure, I think, would cost you too
dear, as well as marrying your widow to disappoint her.
But, for my part, I have no pleasure by 'em but in
despising 'em, wheresoe'er I meet 'em; and then the
pleasure of hoping so to be rid of 'em. But now my
comfort is, I am not worth a shilling in the world, which
all the world shall know; and then I'm sure I shall have
none of 'em come near me.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> A very pretty comfort, which I think you pay too
dear for.&mdash;But is the twenty pound gone since the morning?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> To my boat's crew.&mdash;Would you have the poor,
honest, brave fellows want?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Rather than you or I.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, art thou without money? thou who art a
friend to everybody?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I ventured my last stake upon the squire to nick
him of his mother; and cannot help you to a dinner,
unless you will go dine with my lord&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, no; the ordinary is too dear for me, where
flattery must pay for my dinner: I am no herald or poet.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> We'll go then to the bishop's&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> There you must flatter the old philosophy: I
cannot renounce my reason for a dinner.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Why, then let's go to your alderman's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hang him, rogue! that were not to dine; for
he makes you drunk with lees of sack before dinner, to
take away your stomach: and there you must call usury
and extortion God's blessings, or the honest turning of
the penny; hear him brag of the leather breeches in
which he trotted first to town, and make a greater noise
with his money in his parlour, than his cashiers do
in his counting-house, without hopes of borrowing a
shilling.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, a pox on't! 'tis like dining with the great
gamesters; and when they fall to their common dessert,
to see the heaps of gold drawn on all hands, without
going to twelve. Let us go to my Lady Goodly's.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> There to flatter her looks. You must mistake
her grandchildren for her own; praise her cook, that she
may rail at him; and feed her dogs, not yourself.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> What d'ye think of eating with your lawyer,
then?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Eat with him! damn him! To hear him employ
his barbarous eloquence in a reading upon the two-and-thirty
good bits in a shoulder of veal, and be forced
yourself to praise the cold bribe-pie that stinks, and
drink law-French wine as rough and harsh as his law-French.
A pox on him! I'd rather dine in the Temple-rounds
or walks, with the knights without noses, or the
knights of the post, who are honester fellows and better
company. But let us home and try our fortune; for I'll
stay no longer here for your damned widow.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, let us go home then; for I must go for my
damned widow, and look after my new damned charge.
Three or four hundred years ago a man might have dined
in this Hall.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Manly's</span> <i>Lodging.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, there's success in thy face.
Hast thou prevailed? say.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> As I could wish, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> So; I told thee what thou
wert fit for, and thou wouldst not
believe me. Come, thank me for
bringing thee acquainted with thy
genius. Well, thou hast mollified her heart for me?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> No, sir, not so; but what's better.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How, what's better?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I shall harden your heart against her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Have a care, sir; my heart is too much in
earnest to be fooled with, and my desire at height, and
needs no delay to incite it. What, you are too good a
pimp already, and know how to endear pleasure by withholding
it? But leave off your page's bawdy-house
tricks, sir, and tell me, will she be kind?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Kinder than you could wish, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> So, then: well, prithee, what said she?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> She said&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What? thou'rt so tedious: speak comfort to
me; what?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> That of all things you are her aversion.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> That she would sooner take a bedfellow out of an
hospital, and diseases into her arms, than you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> That she would rather trust her honour with a
dissolute debauched hector, nay worse, with a finical
baffled coward, all over loathsome with affectation of the
fine gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What's all this you say?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, that my offers of your love to her were more
offensive, than when parents woo their virgin-daughters
to the enjoyment of riches only; and that you were in
all circumstances as nauseous to her as a husband on
compulsion.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold! I understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> So, 'twill work, I see. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Did you not tell me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> She called you ten thousand ruffians.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold, I say.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Brutes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Sea-monsters&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn your intelligence! Hear me a little now.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, surly coward she called you too.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Won't you hold yet? Hold, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, sir, pardon me; I could not but tell you she
had the baseness, the injustice, to call you coward, sir;
coward, coward, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not yet&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I've done:&mdash;coward, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Did not you say, she was kinder than I could
wish her?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How then?&mdash;O&mdash;I understand you now. At
first she appeared in rage and disdain; the truest sign of
a coming woman: but at last you prevailed, it seems; did
you not?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> So then; let's know that only: come, prithee,
without delays. I'll kiss thee for that news beforehand.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> So; the kiss I'm sure is welcome to me, whatsoe'er
the news will be to you. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come, speak, my dear volunteer.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> How welcome were that kind word too, if it were
not for another woman's sake! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What, won't you speak? You prevailed for me
at last, you say?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No more of your fooling, sir: it will not agree
with my impatience or temper.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Then not to fool you, sir, I spoke to her for you,
but prevailed for myself; she would not hear me when I
spoke in your behalf, but bid me say what I would in my
own, though she gave me no occasion, she was so coming,
and so was kinder, sir, than you could wish; which I was
only afraid to let you know, without some warning.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How's this? Young man, you are of a lying
age; but I must hear you out, and if&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I would not abuse you, and cannot wrong her by
any report of her, she is so wicked.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How, wicked! had she the impudence, at the
second sight of you only&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Impudence, sir! oh, she has impudence enough
to put a court out of countenance, and debauch a stews.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, what said she?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Her tongue, I confess, was silent; but her speaking
eyes gloated such things, more immodest and lascivious
than ravishers can act, or women under a confinement
think.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I know there are those whose eyes reflect more
obscenity than the glasses in alcoves; but there are others
too who use a little art with their looks, to make 'em seem
more beautiful, not more loving; which vain young
fellows like you are apt to interpret in their own favour,
and to the lady's wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Seldom, sir. Pray, have you a care of gloating
eyes; for he that loves to gaze upon 'em, will find at last
a thousand fools and cuckolds in 'em instead of cupids.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Very well, sir.&mdash;But what, you had only eye-kindness
from Olivia?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I tell you again, sir, no woman sticks there; eye-promises
of love they only keep; nay, they are contracts
which make you sure of 'em. In short, sir, she seeing
me, with shame and amazement dumb, unactive, and
resistless, threw her twisting arms about my neck, and
smothered me with a thousand tasteless kisses. Believe
me, sir, they were so to me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why did you not avoid 'em then?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I fenced with her eager arms, as you did with the
grapples of the enemy's fireship; and nothing but cutting
'em off could have freed me.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damned, damned woman, that could be so
false and infamous! and damned, damned heart of mine,
that cannot yet be false, though so infamous! what easy,
tame suffering trampled things does that little god of
talking cowards make of us! but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> So; it works, I find, as I expected. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But she was false to me before, she told me so
herself, and yet I could not quite believe it; but she was,
so that her second falseness is a favour to me, not an
injury, in revenging me upon the man that wronged me
first of her love. Her love! a whore's, a witch's love!&mdash;But
what, did she not kiss well, sir?&mdash;I'm sure I
thought her lips&mdash;but I must not think of 'em more&mdash;but
yet they are such I could still kiss&mdash;grow to&mdash;and
then tear off with my teeth, grind 'em into mammocks,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
and spit 'em into her cuckold's face.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Poor man, how uneasy he is! I have hardly the
heart to give so much pain, though withal I give him
cure, and to myself new life. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But what, her kisses sure could not but warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
you into desire at last, or a compliance with hers at
least?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, more, I confess&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What more? speak.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> All you could fear had passed between us, if I
could have been made to wrong you, sir, in that nature.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Could have been made! you lie, you did.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Indeed, sir, 'twas impossible for me; besides, we
were interrupted by a visit; but I confess, she would not
let me stir, till I promised to return to her again within
this hour, as soon as it should be dark; by which time
she would dispose of her visit, and her servants, and herself,
for my reception. Which I was fain to promise, to
get from her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But if ever I go near her again, may you, sir,
think me as false to you, as she is; hate and renounce me,
as you ought to do her, and, I hope, will do now.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, but now I think on't, you shall keep your
word with your lady. What, a young fellow, and fail the
first, nay, so tempting an assignation!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> How, sir?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I say, you shall go to her when 'tis dark, and
shall not disappoint her.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I, sir! I should disappoint her more by going.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Her impudence and injustice to you will make
me disappoint her love, loathe her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come, you have my leave; and if you disgust<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
her, I'll go with you, and act love, whilst you shall talk it
only.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> You, sir! nay, then I'll never go near her. You
act love, sir! You must but act it indeed, after all I
have said to you. Think of your honour, sir: love!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, call it revenge, and that is honourable:
I'll be avenged on her; and thou shalt be my second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Not in a base action, sir, when you are your own
enemy. O go not near her, sir; for Heaven's sake, for
your own, think not of it!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How concerned you are! I thought I should
catch you. What, you are my rival at last, and are in
love with her yourself; and have spoken ill of her out of
your love to her, not me: and therefore would not have
me go to her!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Heaven witness for me, 'tis because I love you
only, I would not have you go to her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come, come, the more I think on't, the more
I'm satisfied you do love her. Those kisses, young man,
I knew were irresistible; 'tis certain.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> There is nothing certain in the world, sir, but my
truth and your courage.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Your servant, sir. Besides, false and ungrateful
as she has been to me, and though I may believe her
hatred to me great as you report it, yet I cannot think
you are so soon and at that rate beloved by her, though
you may endeavour it.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, if that be all, and you doubt it still, sir, I
will conduct you to her; and, unseen, your ears shall
judge of her falseness, and my truth to you, if that will
satisfy you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, there is some satisfaction in being quite
out of doubt; because 'tis that alone withholds us from
the pleasure of revenge.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Revenge! What revenge can you have, sir?
Disdain is best revenged by scorn; and faithless love, by
loving another, and making her happy with the other's
losings. Which, if I might advise&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not a word more.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> What, are you talking of love yet, captain? I
thought you had done with't.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, what did you hear me say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Something imperfectly of love, I think.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I was only wondering why fools, rascals, and
desertless wretches, should still have the better of men
of merit with all women, as much as with their own
common mistress, Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Because most women, like Fortune, are blind,
seem to do all things in jest, and take pleasure in
extravagant actions. Their love deserves neither thanks,
nor blame, for they cannot help it: 'tis all sympathy;
therefore, the noisy, the finical, the talkative, the
cowardly, and effeminate, have the better of the brave,
the reasonable, and man of honour; for they have no
more reason in their love, or kindness, than Fortune
herself.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, they have their reason. First, honour in a
man they fear too much to love; and sense in a lover
upbraids their want of it; and they hate anything that
disturbs their admiration of themselves; but they are of
that vain number, who had rather show their false
generosity, in giving away profusely to worthless flatterers,
than in paying just debts. And, in short, all women,
like fortune (as you say) and rewards, are lost by too
much meriting.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> All women, sir! sure there are some who have
no other quarrel to a lover's merit, but that it begets
their despair of him.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou art young enough to be credulous; but
we&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Sailor.</p>

gentlewoman, and that Major Old&mdash;Old&mdash;Fop, I think
you call him.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Oldfox:&mdash;prithee bid 'em come up, with your
leave, captain, for now I can talk with her upon the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, pray stay; the scene between us will not
be so tedious to you as you think. Besides, you shall
see how I rigged my 'squire out, with the remains
of my shipwrecked wardrobe; he is under your sea
valet-de-chambre's hands, and by this time dressed,
and will be worth your seeing. Stay, and I'll fetch my
fool.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No; you know I cannot easily laugh: besides,
my volunteer and I have business abroad.

<p><i>Wid.</i> What, nobody here! did not the fellow say he
was within?</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Yes, lady; and he may be perhaps a little busy
at present; but if you think the time long till he comes,
[<i>Unfolding papers</i>] I'll read you here some of the fruits of
my leisure, the overflowings of my fancy and pen.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
To value me right, she must know my parts.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>]
Come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, no; I have reading work enough of my
own in my bag, I thank you.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Ay, law, madam; but here's a poem, in blank
verse, which I think a handsome declaration of one's
passion.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O, if you talk of declarations, I'll show you one
of the prettiest penned things, which I mended too myself,
you must know.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Nay, lady, if you have used yourself so much to
the reading harsh law, that you hate smooth poetry, here
is a character for you, of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> A character! nay, then I'll show you my bill in
chancery here, that gives you such a character of my
adversary, makes him as black&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Pshaw! away, away, lady! But if you think the
character too long, here is an epigram, not above twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
lines, upon a cruel lady, who decreed her servant should
hang himself, to demonstrate his passion.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Decreed! if you talk of decreeing, I have such a
decree here, drawn by the finest clerk&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> O lady, lady, all interruption, and no sense
between us, as if we were lawyers at the bar! but I had
forgot, Apollo and Littleton never lodge in a head
together. If you hate verses, I'll give you a cast of my
politics in prose. 'Tis "a Letter to a Friend in the
Country;" which is now the way of all such sober solid
persons as myself, when they have a mind to publish
their disgust to the times; though perhaps, between you
and I, they have no friend in the country. And sure a
politic, serious person may as well have a feigned friend
in the country to write to, as an idle poet a feigned
mistress to write to. And so here's my letter to a friend,
or no friend, in the country, concerning the late conjuncture
of affairs, in relation to coffee-houses; or,
"The Coffee-man's Case."</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, if your letter have a case in't, 'tis something;
but first I'll read you a letter of mine to a friend
in the country, called a letter of attorney.</p>

gaudy suit and red breeches of</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> What, interruption still! O the plague of interruption!
worse to an author than the plague of critics.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What's this I see? Jerry Blackacre, my minor,
in red breeches! What, hast thou left the modest
seemly garb of gown and cap for this? and have I
lost all my good inns-of-chancery breeding upon thee
then? and thou wilt go a-breeding thyself from our inn
of chancery and Westminster Hall, at coffee-houses,
and ordinaries, play-houses, tennis-courts, and bawdy-houses?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, ay, what then? perhaps I will; but what's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
that to you? Here's my guardian and tutor now,
forsooth, that I am out of your huckster's hands.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How! thou hast not chosen him for thy guardian
yet?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> No, but he has chosen me for his charge, and
that's all one; and I'll do anything he'll have me, and go
all the world over with him; to ordinaries, and bawdy-houses,
or anywhere else.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> To ordinaries and bawdy-houses! have a care,
minor, thou wilt enfeeble there thy estate and body: do
not go to ordinaries and bawdy-houses, good Jerry.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Why, how come you to know any ill by bawdy-houses?
you never had any hurt by 'em, had you,
forsooth? Pray hold yourself contented; if I do go
where money and wenches are to be had, you may thank
yourself; for you used me so unnaturally, you would
never let me have a penny to go abroad with; nor so
much as come near the garret where your maidens lay;
nay, you would not so much as let me play at hotcockles
with 'em, nor have any recreation with 'em though one
should have kissed you behind, you were so unnatural a
mother, so you were.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Ay, a very unnatural mother, faith, squire.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But, Jerry, consider thou art yet but a minor;
however, if thou wilt go home with me again, and be a
good child, thou shalt see&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Madam, I must have a better care of my heir
under age, than so; I would sooner trust him alone with
a stale waiting-woman and a parson, than with his widow-mother
and her lover or lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Why, thou villain, part mother and minor! rob
me of my child and my writings! but thou shalt find
there's law; and as in the case of ravishment of guard&mdash;Westminster
the Second.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Young gentleman squire, pray be ruled by your
mother and your friends.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Yes, I'll be ruled by my friends, therefore not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
my mother, so I won't: I'll choose him for my guardian
till I am of age; nay, maybe, for as long as I live.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Wilt thou so, thou wretch? and when thou'rt of
age, thou wilt sign, seal and deliver too, wilt thou?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Yes, marry will I, if you go there too.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O do not squeeze wax, son; rather go to ordinaries
and bawdy-houses, than squeeze wax. If thou
dost that, farewell the goodly manor of Blackacre, with
all its woods, underwoods, and appurtenances whatever!
Oh, oh! [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Come, madam, in short, you see I am resolved
to have a share in the estate, yours or your son's; if I
cannot get you, I'll keep him, who is less coy, you find;
but if you would have your son again, you must take me
too. Peace or war? love or law? You see my hostage
is in my hand: I'm in possession.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, if one of us must be ruined, e'en let it be
him. By my body, a good one! Did you ever know
yet a widow marry or not marry for the sake of her
child? I'd have you to know, sir, I shall be hard enough
for you both yet, without marrying you, if Jerry won't
be ruled by me. What say you, booby, will you be
ruled? speak.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Let one alone, can't you?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Wilt thou choose him for guardian, whom I
refuse for husband?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, to choose, I thank you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> And are all my hopes frustrated? Shall I never
hear thee put cases again to John the butler, or our
vicar? never see thee amble the circuit with the judges;
and hear thee, in our town-hall, louder than the crier?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> No, for I have taken my leave of lawyering and
pettifogging.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Pettifogging! thou profane villain, hast thou so?
Pettifogging!&mdash;then you shall take your leave of me, and
your estate too; thou shalt be an alien to me and it
forever. Pettifogging!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> O, but if you go there too, mother, we have the
deeds and settlements, I thank you. Would you cheat
me of my estate, i'fac?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, no, I will not cheat your little brother Bob;
for thou wert not born in wedlock.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> How's that?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> How? what quirk has she got in her head now?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I say, thou canst not, shalt not inherit the
Blackacres' estate.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Why? why, forsooth? What d'ye mean, if you go
there too?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Thou art but my base child; and according to
the law, canst not inherit it. Nay, thou art not so much
as bastard eigne.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> What, what, am I then the son of a whore, mother?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> The law says&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Madam, we know what the law says; but have a
care what you say. Do not let your passion, to ruin your
son, ruin your reputation.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Hang reputation, sir! am not I a widow? have
no husband, nor intend to have any? Nor would you,
I suppose, now have me for a wife. So I think now I'm
revenged on my son and you, without marrying, as I told
you.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But consider, madam.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> What, have you no shame left in you, mother?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Wonder not at it, major. 'Tis often the poor
pressed widow's case, to give up her honour to save her
jointure; and seem to be a light woman, rather than
marry: as some young men, they say, pretend to have
the filthy disease, and lose their credit with most women,
to avoid the importunities of some. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Oldfox</span>.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But one word with you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, no, sir. Come, major, let us make haste
now to the Prerogative-court.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> But, lady, if what you say be true, will you stigmatise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
your reputation on record? and if it be not true,
how will you prove it?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Pshaw! I can prove anything: and for my reputation,
know, major, a wise woman will no more value
her reputation, in disinheriting a rebellious son of a good
estate, than she would in getting him, to inherit an estate.
[<i>Exeunt</i> Widow <span class="smcap">Blackacre</span> <i>and</i> Major <span class="smcap">Oldfox</span>.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Madam.&mdash;We must not let her go so, squire.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Nay, the devil can't stop her though, if she has a
mind to't. But come, bully-guardian, we'll go and advise
with three attorneys, two proctors, two solicitors, and a
shrewd man of Whitefriars, neither attorney, proctor, nor
solicitor, but as pure a pimp to the law as any of 'em:
and sure all they will be hard enough for her, for I fear,
bully-guardian, you are too good a joker to have any law
in your head.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Thou'rt in the right on't, squire, I understand no
law; especially that against bastards, since I'm sure the
custom is against that law, and more people get estates
by being so, than lose 'em. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Plausible</span> <i>and</i> Boy <i>with a candle.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Little gentleman, your most obedient, faithful,
humble servant. Where, I beseech you, is that divine
person, your noble lady?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Gone out, my lord; but commanded me to give
you this letter. [<i>Gives him a letter.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Which he must not observe.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Gone out, sir; but I must beg a word with you.
[<i>Gives him a letter, and exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> For me? So.&mdash;[<i>Puts up the letter.</i>] Servant,
servant, my lord; you see the lady knew of your coming,
for she is gone out.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Sir, I humbly beseech you not to censure
the lady's good breeding: she has reason to use more
liberty with me than with any other man.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> How, viscount, how?</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, I humbly beseech you, be not in
choler; where there is most love, there may be most
freedom.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay, then 'tis time to come to an eclaircissement
with you, and to tell you, you must think no more of this
lady's love.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Why, under correction, dear sir?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> There are reasons, reasons, viscount.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> What, I beseech you, noble sir?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Prithee, prithee, be not impertinent, my lord;
some of you lords are such conceited, well-assured, impertinent
rogues.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> And you noble wits are so full of shamming
and drolling, one knows not where to have you
seriously.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well, you shall find me in bed with this lady one
of these days.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, I beseech you, spare the lady's honour;
for hers and mine will be all one shortly.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Prithee, my lord, be not an ass. Dost thou
think to get her from me? I have had such encouragements&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> I have not been thought unworthy of
'em.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> What, not like mine! Come to an eclaircissement,
as I said.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Why, seriously then, she has told me
viscountess sounded prettily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And me, that Novel was a name she would
sooner change hers for than for any title in England.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> She has commended the softness and respectfulness
of my behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> She has praised the briskness of my raillery, of
all things, man.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The sleepiness of my eyes she liked.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Sleepiness! dulness, dulness. But the fierceness
of mine she adored.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The brightness of my hair she liked.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> The brightness! no, the greasiness, I warrant.
But the blackness and lustre of mine she admires.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The gentleness of my smile.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> The subtilty of my leer.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The clearness of my complexion.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> The redness of my lips.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The whiteness of my teeth.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> My jaunty way of picking them.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> The sweetness of my breath.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Ha! ha! nay, then she abused you, 'tis plain;
for you know what Manly said:&mdash;the sweetness of your
pulvillio she might mean; but for your breath! ha! ha!
ha! Your breath is such, man, that nothing but tobacco
can perfume; and your complexion nothing could mend
but the small-pox.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Well, sir, you may please to be merry; but,
to put you out of all doubt, sir, she has received some
jewels from me of value.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And presents from me; besides what I presented
her jauntily, by way of ombre, of three or four hundred
pounds value, which I'm sure are the earnest-pence for
our love-bargain.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Nay, then, sir, with your favour, and to make
an end of all your hopes, look you there, sir, she has
writ to me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> How! how! well, well, and so she has to me;
look you there&mdash;[<i>They deliver to each other their letters.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> What's here?</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> How's this?
[<i>Reads out.</i>]&mdash;"My dear lord,&mdash;You'll excuse me for
breaking my word with you, since 'twas to oblige, not
offend you; for I am only gone abroad but to disappoint
Novel, and meet you in the drawing-room; where I
expect you with as much impatience as when I used to
suffer Novel's visits&mdash;the most impertinent fop that ever
affected the name of a wit, therefore not capable, I hope,
to give you jealousy; for, for your sake alone, you saw I
renounced an old lover, and will do all the world. Burn
the letter, but lay up the kindness of it in your heart,
with your&mdash;Olivia."
Very fine! but pray let's see mine.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> I understand it not; but sure she cannot
think so of me.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> [<i>Reads the other letter.</i>] Hum! ha!&mdash;"meet&mdash;for
your sake"&mdash;hum&mdash;"quitted an old lover&mdash;world&mdash;burn&mdash;in
your heart&mdash;with your&mdash;Olivia."
Just the same, the names only altered.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> Surely there must be some mistake, or somebody
has abused her and us.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Yes, you are abused, no doubt on't, my lord;
but I'll to Whitehall, and see.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> And I, where I shall find you are abused.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Where, if it be so, for our comfort, we cannot
fail of meeting with fellow-sufferers enough; for, as
Freeman said of another, she stands in the drawing room,
like the glass, ready for all comers, to set their gallantry
by her: and, like the glass too, lets no man go from her
unsatisfied with himself. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Yes, yes, madam, I am very sure.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Go then to the Old Exchange, to Westminster,
Holborn, and all the other places I told you of; I shall
not need you these two hours: begone, and take the

I am gone out, to all that ask.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Yes, madam. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And my new lover will not ask, I'm sure; he
has his lesson, and cannot miss me here, though in the

is yet but seven&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> How! who's that you expected after seven?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ha! my husband returned! and have I been

<p><i>Ver.</i> Speak, I say, who was't you expected after seven?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What shall I say?&mdash;oh&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Why
'tis but seven days, is it, dearest, since you went out of

<p><i>Ver.</i> No, sure, 'tis but five days since I left you.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Nay, then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I told him I was married to put an end to his
love and my trouble; but to whom, is yet a secret kept
from him and all the world. And I have used him so
scurvily, his great spirit will ne'er return to reason it
farther with me: I have sent him to sea again, I
warrant.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> 'Twas bravely done. And sure he will now hate
the shore more than ever, after so great a disappointment.
Be you sure only to keep a while our great
secret, till he be gone. In the mean time, I'll lead the
easy, honest fool by the nose, as I used to do; and
whilst he stays, rail with him at thee; and when he's
gone, laugh with thee at him. But have you his cabinet
of jewels safe? part not with a seed-pearl to him, to keep
him from starving.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nor from hanging.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> He cannot recover 'em; and, I think, will scorn
to beg 'em again.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But, my life, have you taken the thousand
guineas he left in my name out of the goldsmith's hands?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ay, ay; they are removed to another goldsmith's.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ay, but, my soul, you had best have a care he
find not where the money is; for his present wants, as
I'm informed, are such as will make him inquisitive
enough.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> You say true, and he knows the man too; but
I'll remove it to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> To-morrow! O do not stay till to-morrow; go
to-night, immediately.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Now I think on't, you advise well, and I will go
presently.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Presently! instantly! I will not let you stay a
jot.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I will then, though I return not home till twelve.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, though not till morning, with all my heart.
Go, dearest; I am impatient till you are gone.&mdash;[<i>Thrusts
him out.</i>] So, I have at once now brought about those
two grateful businesses, which all prudent women do
together, secured money and pleasure; and now all
interruptions of the last are removed. Go, husband, and
come up, friend; just the buckets in the well; the
absence of one brings the other. But I hope, like them
too, they will not meet in the way, jostle, and clash
together.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>treading softly and staying
behind at some distance.</i></p>

<p>So, are you come? (but not the husband-bucket, I hope,
again.)&mdash;Who's there? my dearest? [<i>Softly.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> My life&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Right, right.&mdash;Where are thy lips? Here, take
the dumb and best welcomes, kisses and embraces; 'tis
not a time for idle words. In a duel of love, as in
others, parleying shows basely. Come, we are alone;
and now the word is only satisfaction, and defend not
thyself.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How's this? Why, she makes love like a devil in
a play; and in this darkness, which conceals her angel's
face, if I were apt to be afraid, I should think her a devil.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What, you traverse ground, young gentleman!
[<span class="smcap">Fidelia</span> <i>avoiding her.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I take breath only.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Good Heavens! how was I deceived! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, you are a coward; what, are you afraid of
the fierceness of my love?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Yes, madam, lest its violence might presage its
change; and I must needs be afraid you would leave
me quickly, who could desert so brave a gentleman as
Manly.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, name not his name! for in a time of stolen
joys, as this is, the filthy name of husband were not a
more allaying sound.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> There's some comfort yet. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But did you not love him?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Never. How could you think it?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Because he thought it; who is a man of that
sense, nice discerning, and diffidency, that I should
think it hard to deceive him.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No; he that distrusts most the world, trusts
most to himself, and is but the more easily deceived,
because he thinks he can't be deceived. His cunning is
like the coward's sword, by which he is oftener worsted
than defended.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Yet, sure, you used no common art to deceive
him.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I knew he loved his own singular moroseness so
well, as to dote upon any copy of it; wherefore I feigned
a hatred to the world too that he might love me in
earnest: but, if it had been hard to deceive him, I'm
sure 'twere much harder to love him. A dogged, ill-mannered&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> D'ye hear, sir? pray, hear her. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Surly, untractable, snarling brute! He! a mastiff
dog were as fit a thing to make a gallant of.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, a goat, or monkey, were fitter for thee.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I must confess, for my part, though my rival, I
cannot but say he has a manly handsomeness in's face
and mien.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> So has a Saracen in the sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Is proper, and well made.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As a drayman.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Has wit.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> He rails at all mankind.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> And undoubted courage.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Like the hangman's; can murder a man when
his hands are tied. He has cruelty indeed; which is no
more courage, than his railing is wit.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thus women, and men like women, are too
hard for us, when they think we do not hear 'em: and
reputation, like other mistresses, is never true to a man
in his absence. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> He is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Prithee, no more of him: I thought I had
satisfied you enough before, that he could never be a
rival for you to apprehend. And you need not be more
assured of my aversion to him, than by the last testimony
of my love to you; which I am ready to give you. Come,
my soul, this way. [<i>Pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But, madam, what could make you dissemble love
to him, when 'twas so hard a thing for you; and flatter
his love to you?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> That which makes all the world flatter and dissemble,
'twas his money: I had a real passion for that.
Yet I loved not that so well, as for it to take him; for
as soon as I had his money I hastened his departure like
a wife, who when she has made the most of a dying
husband's breath, pulls away his pillow.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damned money! its master's potent rival still;
and like a saucy pimp, corrupts itself the mistress it procures
for us. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But I did not think with you, my life, to pass
my time in talking. Come hither, come; yet stay, till I
have locked a door in the other room, that may chance
to let us in some interruption; which reciting poets or
losing gamesters fear not more than I at this time do. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Well, I hope you are now satisfied, sir, and will
be gone to think of your revenge?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, I am not satisfied, and must stay to be
revenged.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> How, sir? You'll use no violence to her, I hope,
and forfeit your own life, to take away hers? that were
no revenge.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, no, you need not fear: my revenge shall
only be upon her honour, not her life.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> How, sir? her honour? O Heavens! consider,
sir, she has no honour. D'ye call that revenge? can you
think of such a thing? But reflect, sir, how she hates
and loathes you.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, so much she hates me, that it would be a
revenge sufficient to make her accessory to my pleasure,
and then let her know it.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> No, sir, no; to be revenged on her now, were to
disappoint her. Pray, sir, let us begone. [<i>Pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Hold off! What, you are my rival then! and
therefore you shall stay, and keep the door for me, whilst
I go in for you; but when I'm gone, if you dare to stir
off from this very board, or breathe the least murmuring
accent, I'll cut her throat first; and if you love her, you
will not venture her life.&mdash;Nay, then I'll cut your throat
too; and I know you love your own life at least.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But, sir; good sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Not a word more, lest I begin my revenge on
her by killing you.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But are you sure 'tis revenge that makes you do
this? how can it be?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Whist!</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> 'Tis a strange revenge, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> If you make me stay, I shall keep my word, and
begin with you. No more.

she would act it again with this young fellow here.&mdash;Where

an apology for your leaving her so soon; for I have said
not a word to her; but have kept your counsel, as I

<p><i>Ver.</i> When you have satisfied me, madam, I will.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I hope, sir, you are too much a gentleman to
urge those secrets from a woman which concern her
honour. You may guess my misfortune to be love by my
disguise: but a pair of breeches could not wrong you,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I may believe love has changed your outside,
which could not wrong me; but why did my wife run
away?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I know not, sir; perhaps because she would
not be forced to discover me to you, or to guide me from
your suspicions, that you might not discover me yourself;
which ungentlemanlike curiosity I hope you will cease to
have, and let me go.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Well, madam, if I must not know who you are,
'twill suffice for me only to know certainly what you are;

it yourself.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ah, cousin! nothing troubles me
but that I have given the malicious
world its revenge, and reason now to
talk as freely of me as I used to do of
it.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Faith, then, let not that trouble
you; for, to be plain, cousin, the world
cannot talk worse of you than it did before.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> How, cousin! I'd have you to know, before this
<i>faux pas</i>, this trip of mine, the world could not talk
of me.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Only that you mind other people's actions so
much that you take no care of your own, but to hide
'em; that, like a thief, because you know yourself most
guilty, you impeach your fellow-criminals first, to clear
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O wicked world!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> That you pretend an aversion to all mankind in
public, only that their wives and mistresses may not be
jealous, and hinder you of their conversation in private.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Base world!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> That abroad you fasten quarrels upon innocent
men for talking of you, only to bring 'em to ask your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>

who were hardly your acquaintance before.</p>

plays, only that you may not be censured for never

dark with a woman in man's clothes: but have a care of
a man in woman's clothes.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What does he mean? he dissembles only to get
me into his power: or has my dear friend made him
believe he was a woman? My husband may be deceived
by him, but I'm sure I was not. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Come, come, you need not have lain out of your

know who she is, I'm satisfied without. Come hither.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Sure you do know her; she has told you herself,
I suppose.</p>

was interrupted by the goldsmith, you know, and was
forced to lock her into your chamber, to keep her from
his sight; but, when I returned, I found she was got
away by tying the window-curtains to the balcony, by
which she slid down into the street. For, you must
know, I jested with her, and made her believe I'd ravish
her; which she apprehended, it seems, in earnest.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And she got from you?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And is quite gone?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I'm glad on't&mdash;otherwise you had ravished her,
sir? But how durst you go so far, as to make her
believe you would ravish her? let me understand that,
sir. What! there's guilt in your face, you blush too:
nay, then you did ravish her, you did, you base fellow!
What, ravish a woman in the first month of our marriage!
'tis a double injury to me, thou base, ungrateful man!
wrong my bed already, villain! I could tear out those
false eyes, barbarous, unworthy wretch!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> So, so!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Prithee hear, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I will never hear you, my plague, my torment!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I swear&mdash;prithee, hear me.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I have heard already too many of your false oaths
and vows, especially your last in the church. O wicked
man! and wretched woman that I was! I wish I had
then sunk down into a grave, rather than to have given
you my hand, to be led to your loathsome bed. Oh&mdash;Oh&mdash;[<i>Pretends
to weep.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> So, very fine! just a marriage-quarrel! which
though it generally begins by the wife's fault, yet, in the
conclusion, it becomes the husband's; and whosoever
offends at first, he only is sure to ask pardon at last. My
dear&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> My devil!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Come, prithee be appeased, and go home; I have
bespoken our supper betimes: for I could not eat till I
found you. Go, I'll give you all kind of satisfactions; and
one, which uses to be a reconciling one, two hundred of
those guineas I received last night, to do what you will
with.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What, would you pay me for being your bawd?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Nay, prithee no more; go, and I'll thoroughly
satisfy you when I come home; and then, too, we will
have a fit of laughter at Manly, whom I am going to find
at the Cock in Bow-street, where I hear he dined. Go,
dearest, go home.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> A very pretty turn, indeed, this! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Now, cousin, since by my wife I have that honour
and privilege of calling you so, I have something to beg
of you too; which is not to take notice of our marriage
to any whatever yet a while, for some reasons very important
to me. And, next, that you will do my wife the
honour to go home with her; and me the favour, to use
that power you have with her, in our reconcilement.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> That I dare promise, sir, will be no hard matter.
Your servant.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.]&mdash;Well, cousin, this, I
confess, was reasonable hypocrisy; you were the better
for't.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What hypocrisy?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Why, this last deceit of your husband was lawful,
since in your own defence.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What deceit? I'd have you to know I never
deceived my husband.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> You do not understand me, sure: I say, this
was an honest come-off, and a good one. But 'twas a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
sign your gallant had had enough of your conversation,
since he could so dexterously cheat your husband in
passing for a woman.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What d'ye mean, once more, with my gallant
and passing for a woman?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> What do you mean? you see your husband took
him for a woman.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Whom?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Heyday! why, the man he found you with,
for whom last night you were so much afraid; and who
you told me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Lord, you rave sure!</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Why, did you not tell me last night&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I know not what I might tell you last night, in a
fright.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Ay, what was that fright for? for a woman?
besides, were you not afraid to see your husband just
now? I warrant only for having been found with a
woman! Nay, did you not just now, too, own your
false step, or trip, as you called it? which was with a
woman too! fy, this fooling is so insipid, 'tis offensive!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And fooling with my honour will be more
offensive. Did you not hear my husband say he found
me with a woman in man's clothes? and d'ye think he
does not know a man from a woman?</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Not so well, I'm sure, as you do; therefore I'd
rather take your word.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What, you grow scurrilous, and are, I find, more
censorious than the world! I must have a care of you,
I see.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> No, you need not fear yet, I'll keep your secret.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> My secret! I'd have you to know, I have no
need of confidants, though you value yourself upon being
a good one.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> O admirable confidence! you show more in
denying your wickedness, than other people in glorying
in't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Confidence, to me! to me such language! nay,
then I'll never see your face again.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I'll quarrel
with her, that people may never believe I was in her
power; but take for malice all the truth she may speak
against me.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Lettice, where are you! Let us
be gone from this censorious ill woman.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Nay, thou shalt stay a little, to damn
thyself quite.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] One word first, pray, madam;
can you swear that whom your husband found you with&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Swear! ay, that whosoever 'twas that stole up,
unknown, into my room, when 'twas dark, I know not,
whether man or woman, by Heavens! by all that's good;
or, may I never more have joys here, or in the other
world! Nay, may I eternally&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Be damned. So, so, you are damned enough
already by your oaths; and I enough confirmed, and
now you may please to be gone. Yet take this advice
with you, in this plain-dealing age, to leave off forswearing
yourself; for when people hardly think the better of
a woman for her real modesty, why should you put that
great constraint upon yourself to feign it?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O hideous, hideous advice! let us go out of the
hearing of it. She will spoil us, Lettice.</p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The Cock in Bow Street. A table and
bottles.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How! saved her honour by making her husband
believe you were a woman! 'Twas well, but hard enough
to do, sure.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> We were interrupted before he could contradict
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But can't you tell me, d'ye say, what kind of
man he was?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I was so frightened, I confess, I can give no other
account of him, but that he was pretty tall, round-faced,
and one, I'm sure, I ne'er had seen before.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But she, you say, made you swear to return to-night?</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But I have since sworn, never to go near her
again; for the husband would murder me, or worse, if he
caught me again.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, I will go with you, and defend you to-night,
and then I'll swear, too, never to go near her again.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Nay, indeed, sir, I will not go, to be accessory to
your death too. Besides, what should you go again, sir,
for?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No disputing, or advice, sir, you have reason to
know I am unalterable. Go therefore presently, and write
her a note, to inquire if her assignation with you holds;
and if not to be at her own house, where else; and be
importunate to gain admittance to her to-night. Let
your messenger, ere he deliver your letter, inquire first if
her husband be gone out. Go, 'tis now almost six of the
clock; I expect you back here before seven, with leave
to see her then. Go, do this dextrously, and expect the
performance of my last night's promise, never to part
with you.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Ay, sir; but will you be sure to remember that?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Did I ever break my word? Go, no more replies,
or doubts. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>

<p>Where hast thou been?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> In the next room with my Lord Plausible and
Novel.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, we came hither, because 'twas a private
house; but with thee indeed no house can be private,
for thou hast that pretty quality of the familiar fops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
the town, who, in an eating-house, always keep company
with all people in't but those they came with.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I went into their room, but to keep them, and
my own fool the squire, out of your room; but you shall
be peevish now, because you have no money. But why
the devil won't you write to those we were speaking of?
Since your modesty, or your spirit, will not suffer you to
speak to 'em, to lend you money, why won't you try 'em
at last that way?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Because I know 'em already, and can bear want
better than denials, nay, than obligations.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Deny you! they cannot. All of 'em have been
your intimate friends.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, they have been people only I have obliged
particularly.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Very well; therefore you ought to go to 'em the
rather, sure.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, no. Those you have obliged most, most
certainly avoid you, when you can oblige 'em no longer;
and they take your visits like so many duns. Friends,
like mistresses, are avoided for obligations past.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Pshaw! but most of 'em are your relations;
men of great fortune and honour.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes; but relations have so much honour as to
think poverty taints the blood, and disown their wanting
kindred; believing, I suppose, that as riches at first make
a gentleman, the want of 'em degrades him. But damn
'em! now I am poor, I'll anticipate their contempt, and
disown them.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> But you have many a female acquaintance whom
you have been liberal to, who may have a heart to refund
to you a little, if you would ask it: they are not all
Olivias.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Damn thee! how couldst thou think of such a
thing? I would as soon rob my footman of his wages.
Besides, 'twere in vain too: for a wench is like a box in
an ordinary, receives all people's money easily, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
is no getting, nay, shaking any out again; and he that
fills it is sure never to keep the key.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, but noble captain, would you make me
believe that you, who know half the town, have so many
friends, and have obliged so many, can't borrow fifty or
a hundred pounds?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Why, noble lieutenant, you who know all the
town, and call all you know friends, methinks should not
wonder at it; since you find ingratitude too. For how
many lords' families (though descended from blacksmiths
or tinkers) hast thou called great and illustrious? how
many ill tables called good eating? how many noisy coxcombs
wits? how many pert cocking<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> cowards stout?
how many tawdry affected rogues well-dressed? how
many perukes admired? and how many ill verses
applauded? and yet canst not borrow a shilling. Dost
thou expect I, who always spoke truth, should?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Nay, now you think you have paid me; but
hark you, captain, I have heard of a thing called grinning
honour, but never of starving honour.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, but it has been the fate of some brave
men; and if they won't give me a ship again, I can go
starve anywhere with a musket on my shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Give you a ship! why, you will not solicit it.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> If I have not solicited it by my services, I know
no other way.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Your servant, sir; nay, then I'm satisfied, I must
solicit my widow the closer, and run the desperate fortune
of matrimony on shore. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> How!&mdash;Nay, here is a friend indeed; and he
that has him in his arms can know no wants.
[<i>Embraces</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Dear sir! and he that is in your arms is secure
from all fears whatever: nay, our nation is secure by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
your defeat at sea, and the Dutch that fought against you
have proved enemies to themselves only in bringing you
back to us.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Fy! fy! this from a friend? and yet from any
other 'twere insufferable: I thought I should never have
taken anything ill from you.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> A friend's privilege is to speak his mind, though
it be taken ill.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But your tongue need not tell me you think too
well of me; I have found it from your heart, which
spoke in actions, your unalterable heart. But Olivia is
false, my friend, which I suppose is no news to you.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> He's in the right on't. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But couldst thou not keep her true to me?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Not for my heart, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But could you not perceive it at all before I
went? Could she so deceive us both?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I must confess, the first time I knew it was three
days after your departure, when she received the money
you had left in Lombard-street in her name; and her
tears did not hinder her, it seems, from counting that.
You would trust her with all, like a true generous lover.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> And she like a mean jilting&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Traitorous&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Base&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Damned&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Covetous&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Mercenary whore.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I can hardly hold
from laughing.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, a mercenary whore indeed; for she made
me pay her before I lay with her.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> How!&mdash;Why, have you lain with her?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Nay, she deserves you should report it at least,
though you have not.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Report it! by Heaven, 'tis true!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> How! sure not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I do not use to lie, nor you to doubt me.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> When?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Last night, about seven or eight of the clock.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ha!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Now I remember, I thought she
spake as if she expected some other rather than me. A
confounded whore, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But what, thou wonderest at it! nay, you seem
to be angry too.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I cannot but be enraged against her, for her
usage of you: damned infamous, common jade!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, her cuckold, who first cuckolded me in my
money, shall not laugh all himself: we will do him reason,
shan't we?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But thou dost not, for so great a friend, take
pleasure enough in your friend's revenge, methinks.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Yes, yes; I'm glad to know it, since you have
lain with her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou canst not tell who that rascal, her cuckold,
is?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> She would keep it from you, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Thou wouldst laugh, if thou knewest but all
the circumstances of my having her. Come, I'll tell
thee.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Damn her! I care not to hear any more of her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Faith, thou shalt. You must know&mdash;</p>

I'll tell thee all anon. In the mean time prithee go to
her, but not from me, and try if you can get her to lend
me but a hundred pounds of my money, to supply my
present wants; for I suppose there is no recovering any
of it by law.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Not any: think not of it. Nor by this way
neither.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Go try, at least.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I'll go; but I can satisfy you beforehand it will
be to no purpose. You'll no more find a refunding
wench&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Than a refunding lawyer; indeed their fees
alike scarce ever return. However, try her; put it to
her.</p>

vengeance. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Nay, you shall be our judge, Manly&mdash;Come,
major, I'll speak it to your teeth; if people provoke me
to say bitter things to their faces, they must take what
follows; though, like my lord Plausible, I'd rather do't
civilly behind their backs.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, thou art a dangerous rogue, I've heard,
behind a man's back.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> You wrong him sure, noble captain; he
would do a man no more harm behind his back than to
his face.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I am of my lord's mind.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, a fool, like a coward, is the more to be,
feared behind a man's back, more than a witty man; for
as a coward is more bloody than a brave man, a fool is
more malicious than a man of wit.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> A fool, tar,&mdash;a fool! nay, thou art a brave sea-judge
of wit! a fool! Prithee when did you ever find
me want something to say, as you do often?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, I confess thou art always talking, roaring,
or making a noise; that I'll say for thee.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well, and is talking a sign of a fool?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Yes, always talking, especially too if it be loud
and fast, is the sign of a fool.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Pshaw! talking is like fencing, the quicker the
better; run 'em down, run 'em down, no matter for
parrying; push on still, sa, sa, sa! No matter whether
you argue in form, push in guard or no.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Or hit or no; I think thou always talkest
without thinking, Novel.</p>

allegory, as the old pedant says.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> A young fop!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I ever thought the man of most wit had been
like him of most money, who has no vanity in showing it
everywhere, whilst the beggarly pusher of his fortune has
all he has about him still only to show.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Well, sir, and make a pretty show in the world,
let me tell you; nay, a better than your close hunks. A
pox, give me ready money in play! what care I for a
man's reputation? what are we the better for your
substantial thrifty curmudgeon in wit, sir?</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Thou art a profuse young rogue indeed.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> So much for talking, which, I think, I have
proved a mark of wit; and so is railing, roaring, and
making a noise; for railing is satire, you know; and
roaring and making a noise, humour.</p>

allow him those things for wit; for his parts lie only that
way.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Peace, old fool! I wonder not at thee; but that
young fellows should be so dull, as to say there's no
humour in making a noise, and breaking windows! I
tell you there's wit and humour too in both; and a wit
is as well known by his frolic as by his smile.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Pure rogue! there's your modern wit for you!
Wit and humour in breaking of windows: there's mischief,
if you will, but no wit or humour.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Prithee, prithee, peace, old fool! I tell you,
where there's mischief, there's wit. Don't we esteem the
monkey a wit amongst beasts, only because he's mischievous?
and, let me tell you, as good-nature is a sign
of a fool, being mischievous is a sign of a wit.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> O rogue, rogue! pretend to be a wit, by doing
mischief and railing!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Why, thou, old fool, hast no other pretence to
the name of a wit, but by railing at new plays!</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Thou, by railing at that facetious noble way of
wit, quibbling!</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Thou callest thy dulness gravity; and thy dozing,
thinking.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> You, sir, your dulness, spleen; and you talk
much and say nothing.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> Thou readest much, and understandest nothing, sir.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> You laugh loud, and break no jest.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> You rail, and nobody hangs himself; and thou
hast nothing of the satire but in thy face.</p>

<p><i>Old.</i> And you have no jest, but your face, sir.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come, a pox on you both! you have done like
wits now: for you wits, when you quarrel, never give
over till ye prove one another fools.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And you fools have never any occasion of laughing
at us wits but when we quarrel. Therefore let us be
friends, Oldfox.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> They are such wits as thou art, who make the
name of a wit as scandalous as that of bully: and signify
a loud-laughing, talking, incorrigible, coxcomb, as bully a
roaring hardened coward.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> And would have his noise and laughter pass for
wit, as t'other his huffing and blustering for courage.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Gentlemen, with your leave, here is one I would
speak with; and I have nothing to say to you.
[<i>Puts all out of the room except</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I told you 'twas in vain to think of getting money
out of her. She says, if a shilling would do't, she would
not save you from starving or hanging, or what you
would think worse, begging or flattering; and rails so at
you, one would not think you had lain with her.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> O, friend, never trust for that matter a woman's
railing; for she is no less a dissembler in her hatred than
her love; and as her fondness of her husband is a sign
he's a cuckold, her railing at another man is a sign she
lies with him.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> He's in the right on't: I know not what to trust
to. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But you did not take any notice of it to her, I
hope?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> So!&mdash;Sure he is afraid I should have disproved
him by an inquiry of her: all may be well yet. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What hast thou in thy head that makes thee
seem so unquiet?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Only this base impudent woman's falseness; I
cannot put her out of my head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> O, my dear friend, be not you too sensible of
my wrongs; for then I shall feel 'em too with more pain,
and think 'em unsufferable. Damn her, her money, and
that ill-natured whore too, Fortune herself! But if thou
wouldst ease a little my present trouble, prithee go borrow
me somewhere else some money. I can trouble thee.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> You trouble me, indeed, most sensibly, when you
command me anything I cannot do. I have lately lost a
great deal of money at play, more than I can yet pay; so
that not only my money, but my credit too is gone, and
know not where to borrow: but could rob a church for
you.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Yet would rather end your wants by
cutting your throat.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, then I doubly feel my poverty, since I'm
incapable of supplying thee. [<i>Embraces him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> But, methinks, she that granted you the last
favour, (as they call it,) should not deny you anything.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> [<i>Looking in.</i>] Hey, tarpaulin, have you done?
[<i>Retires again.</i></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I understand not that point of kindness, I confess.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> No, thou dost not understand it, and I have not
time to let you know all now; for these fools, you see,
will interrupt us: but anon, at supper, we'll laugh at
leisure together at Olivia's cuckold, who took a young
fellow, that goes between his wife and me, for a woman.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Senseless, easy rascal! 'twas no wonder she
chose him for a husband; but she thought him, I thank
her, fitter than me, for that blind bearing office.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I could not be deceived in that long woman's
hair tied up behind, nor those infallible proofs, her
pouting swelling breasts: I have handled too many sure
not to know 'em. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> What, you wonder the fellow could be such a
blind coxcomb?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Yes, yes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> [<i>Looking in again.</i>] Nay, prithee, come to us,
Manly. Gad, all the fine things one says in their company,
are lost without thee.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Away, fop! I'm busy yet. [<span class="smcap">Novel</span> <i>retires.</i>]
You see we cannot talk here at our ease: besides, I must
be gone immediately, in order to meeting with Olivia
again to-night.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> To-night! it cannot be, sure&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> I had an appointment just now from her.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> For what time?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> At half an hour after seven precisely.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Don't you apprehend the husband?</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> He! snivelling gull! he a thing to be feared! a
husband! the tamest of creatures!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Very fine! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> But, prithee, in the mean time, go try to get me
some money. Though thou art too modest to borrow
for thyself, thou canst do anything for me, I know. Go;
for I must be gone to Olivia. Go, and meet me here,
anon.&mdash;Freeman, where are you? [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ay, I'll meet with you, I warrant; but it shall be
at Olivia's. Sure, it cannot be: she denies it so calmly,
and with that honest modest assurance, it cannot be true&mdash;and
he does not use to lie&mdash;but belying a woman
when she won't be kind, is the only lie a brave man will
least scruple. But then the woman in man's clothes,
whom he calls a man&mdash;well, but by her breasts I know
her to be a woman&mdash;but then again, his appointment
from her, to meet him again to-night! I am distracted
more with doubt than jealousy. Well, I have no way to
disabuse or revenge myself, but by going home immediately,
putting on a riding-suit, and pretending to my
wife the same business which carried me out of town
last, requires me again to go post to Oxford to-night.
Then, if the appointment he boasts of be true, it's sure to
hold, and I shall have an opportunity either of clearing
her, or revenging myself on both. Perhaps she is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
wench, of an old date, and I am his cully, whilst I think
him mine; and he has seemed to make his wench rich,
only that I might take her off his hands. Or if he has
but lately lain with her, he must needs discover by her
my treachery to him; which I'm sure he will revenge
with my death, and which I must prevent with his, if it
were only but for fear of his too just reproaches; for I
must confess, I never had till now any excuse but that of
interest, for doing ill to him. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come hither; only, I say, be sure you mistake
not the time. You know the house exactly where Olivia
lodges, 'tis just hard by.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well then, bring 'em all, I say, thither, and all
you know that may be then in the house; for the
more witnesses I have of her infamy, the greater will be
my revenge: and be sure you come straight up to her
chamber without more ado. Here, take the watch; you
see 'tis above a quarter past seven; be there in half an
hour exactly.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> You need not doubt my diligence or dexterity;
I am an old scourer, and can naturally beat up a
wench's quarters that won't be civil. Shan't we break
her windows too?</p>

<i>a</i> Waiter <i>following with wine.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Sweetheart, are you sure the door was shut
close, that none of those roysters saw us come in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wait.</i> Yes, mistress; and you shall have a privater
room above, instantly. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> You are safe enough, gentlemen; for I have
been private in this house ere now, upon other occasions,
when I was something younger. Come, gentlemen; in
short, I leave my business to your care and fidelity: and
so here's to you.</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> We are ungrateful rogues if we should not
be honest to you; for we have had a great deal of your
money.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> And you have done me many a good job for't;
and so, here's to you again.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> Why, we have been perjured but six times
for you.</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> Forged but four deeds, with your husband's
last deed of gift.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> And but three wills.</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> And counterfeited hands and seals to some
six bonds; I think that's all, brother?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ay, that's all, gentlemen; and so, here's to you
again.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> Nay, 'twould do one's heart good to be
forsworn for you. You have a conscience in your ways,
and pay us well.</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> You are in the right on't, brother; one
would be damned for her with all one's heart.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> But there are rogues, who make us forsworn
for 'em; and when we come to be paid, they'll be forsworn
too, and not pay us our wages, which they promised
with oaths sufficient.</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> Ay, a great lawyer that shall be nameless
bilked me too.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> That was hard, methinks, that a lawyer should
use gentlemen witnesses no better.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> A lawyer! d'ye wonder a lawyer should
do't? I was bilked by a reverend divine, that preaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
twice on Sundays, and prays half an hour still before
dinner.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How! a conscientious divine and not pay people
for damning themselves! sure then, for all his talking, he
does not believe damnation. But, come, to our business.
Pray be sure to imitate exactly the flourish at the end of
this name. [<i>Pulls out a deed or two.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> O, he's the best in England at untangling
a flourish, madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> And let not the seal be a jot bigger. Observe
well the dash too, at the end of this name.</p>

<p><i>2nd Knight.</i> I warrant you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well, these and many other shifts, poor widows
are put to sometimes; for everybody would be riding a
widow, as they say, and breaking into her jointure. They
think marrying a widow an easy business, like leaping the
hedge where another has gone over before. A widow is
a mere gap, a gap with them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman, Jerry Blackacre</span>, <i>three</i> Bailiffs, <i>a</i>
Constable, <i>and his</i> Assistants <i>with the two</i> Knights
of the Post.</p>

<p>What, shall I never read my things undisturbed again?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> O la! my mother bound hand and foot, and
gaping as if she rose before her time to-day!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> What means this, Oldfox? But I'll release you
from him; you shall be no man's prisoner but mine.
Bailiffs, execute your writ. [<i>Unties her.</i></p>

<p><i>Old.</i> Nay, then, I'll be gone, for fear of being bail,
and paying her debts without being her husband. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Bail.</i> We arrest you in the king's name, at the suit
of Mr. Freeman, guardian to Jeremiah Blackacre, esquire,
in an action of ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How, how, in a choke-bail action! What, and
the pen and-ink gentlemen taken too!&mdash;Have you confessed,
you rogues?</p>

<p><i>1st Knight.</i> We needed not to confess; for the bailiffs
have dogged us hither to the very door, and overheard
all that you and we said.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Undone, undone then! no man was ever too
hard for me till now. O Jerry, child, wilt thou vex again
the womb that bore thee?</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, for bearing me before wedlock, as you say.
But I'll teach you call a Blackacre bastard, though you
were never so much my mother.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, I'm undone! not one trick left?
no law-mesh imaginable?&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.] Cruel sir, a
word with you, I pray.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> In vain, madam; for you have no other way to
release yourself but by the bonds of matrimony.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How, sir, how! that were but to sue out a
habeas-corpus, for a removal from one prison to another.&mdash;Matrimony!</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, bailiffs, away with her.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O stay, sir! can you be so cruel as to bring me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
under covert-baron<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> again, and put it out of my power to
sue in my own name? Matrimony to a woman is worse
than excommunication, in depriving her of the benefit of
the law; and I would rather be deprived of life. But
hark you, sir, I am contented you should hold and enjoy my
person by lease or patent, but not by the spiritual patent
called a licence; that is, to have the privileges of a husband,
without the dominion; that is, <i>Durante beneplacito</i>.
In consideration of which, I will out of my jointure secure
you an annuity of three hundred pounds a year, and pay
your debts; and that's all you younger brothers desire to
marry a widow for, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Well, widow, if&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> What! I hope, bully-guardian, you are not making
agreements without me?</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> No, no. First, widow, you must say no more that
he is a son of a whore; have a care of that. And, then, he
must have a settled exhibition of forty pounds a year, and
a nag of assizes, kept by you, but not upon the common;
and have free ingress, egress, and regress, to and from
your maids' garret.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well, I can grant all that too.</p>

<p><i>Jer.</i> Ay, ay, fair words butter no cabbage: but guardian,
make her sign, sign and seal; for otherwise, if you
knew her as well as I, you would not trust her word for a
farthing.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I warrant thee, squire.&mdash;Well, widow, since thou
art so generous, I will be generous too; and if you'll
secure me four hundred pounds a year, but during your
life, and pay my debts, not above a thousand pounds, I'll
bate you your person, to dispose of as you please.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Have a care, sir, a settlement without a
consideration is void in law; you must do something
for't.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> Prithee, then let the settlement on me be called
alimony; and the consideration, our separation. Come;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
my lawyer, with writings ready drawn, is within, and in
haste. Come.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But, what, no other kind of consideration, Mr.
Freeman? Well, a widow, I see, is a kind of sinecure,
by custom of which the unconscionable incumbent
enjoys the profits, without any duty, but does that still
elsewhere. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> So, I am now prepared once more for my
timorous young lover's reception. My husband is gone;
and go thou out too, thou next interrupter of love.&mdash;[<i>Puts
out the candle.</i>] Kind darkness, that frees us lovers from

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>, <i>followed softly by</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span>.</p>

<p>Come, my dear punctual lover, there is not such another
in the world; thou hast beauty and youth to please a
wife; address and wit, to amuse and fool a husband;
nay, thou hast all things to be wished in a lover, but
your fits. I hope, my dear, you won't have one to-night;
and that you may not, I'll lock the door, though there be
no need of it, but to lock out your fits: for my husband
is just gone out of town again. Come, where are you?
[<i>Goes to the door and locks it.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Well, thou hast impudence enough to give me
fits too, and make revenge itself impotent; hinder me
from making thee yet more infamous, if it can be.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Come, come, my soul, come.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Presently, my dear, we have time enough sure.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> How, time enough! True lovers can no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
think they ever have time enough, than love enough.
You shall stay with me all night; but that is but a lover's
moment. Come.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> But won't you let me give you and myself the
satisfaction of telling you how I abused your husband
last night?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Not when you can give me, and yourself too,
the satisfaction of abusing him again to-night. Come.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Let me but tell you how your husband&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O name not his, or Manly's more loathsome
name, if you love me! I forbid 'em last night: and you
know I mentioned my husband but once, and he came.
No talking, pray, 'twas ominous to us.&mdash;[<i>A noise at the
door.</i>] You make me fancy a noise at the door already,
but I'm resolved not to be interrupted. Where are you?
Come, for rather than lose my dear expectation now, though
my husband were at the door, and the bloody ruffian
Manly here in the room, with all his awful insolence, I
would give myself to this dear hand, to be led away to
heavens of joys, which none but thou canst give.&mdash;[<i>The
noise at the door increases.</i>] But what's this noise at the door?
So, I told you what talking would come to. Ha!&mdash;O
Heavens, my husband's voice!&mdash;[<i>Listens at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Freeman is come too soon.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, 'tis he!&mdash;Then here's the happiest minute lost
that ever bashful boy or trifling woman fooled away! I'm
undone! my husband's reconcilement too was false, as
my joy all delusion. But come this way, here's a back
door.&mdash;[<i>Exit, and returns.</i>] The officious jade has locked
us in, instead of locking others out: but let us then escape
your way, by the balcony; and whilst you pull down the
curtains, I'll fetch from my closet what next will best
secure our escape. I have left my key in the door, and
'twill not suddenly be broken open. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

which she lost in the scuffle.</i>] What means this long
woman's hair, and face! now all of it appears too beautiful
for a man; which I still thought womanish indeed!
What, you have not deceived me too, my little volunteer?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Me she has, I'm sure. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Speak!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Eliza</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> What, cousin, I am brought hither by your
woman, I suppose, to be a witness of the second vindication
of your honour?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Insulting is not generous. You might spare me,
I have you.</p>

<p><i>Eliza.</i> Have a care, cousin, you'll confess anon too
much; and I would not have your secrets.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Come, your blushes answer me sufficiently, and
you have been my volunteer in love. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> I must confess I needed no compulsion to follow
you all the world over; which I attempted in this habit,
partly out of shame to own my love to you, and fear of a
greater shame, your refusal of it; for I knew of your
engagement to this lady, and the constancy of your
nature; which nothing could have altered but herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Dear madam, I desired you to bring me out of
confusion, and you have given me more. I know not
what to speak to you, or how to look upon you; the
sense of my rough, hard, and ill usage of you, (though
chiefly your own fault,) gives me more pain now 'tis over,
than you had when you suffered it: and if my heart, the
refusal of such a woman&mdash;[<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Olivia</span>]&mdash;were not
a sacrifice to profane your love, and a greater wrong to
you than ever yet I did you, I would beg of you to
receive it, though you used it as she had done; for
though it deserved not from her the treatment she gave
it, it does from you.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Then it has had punishment sufficient from her
already, and needs no more from me; and, I must confess,
I would not be the only cause of making you break
your last night's oath to me, of never parting with me; if
you do not forget or repent it.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Then take for ever my heart, and this with it;&mdash;[<i>Gives
her the cabinet</i>] for 'twas given to you before, and
my heart was before your due: I only beg leave to dispose
of these few.&mdash;Here, madam, I never yet left my
wench unpaid.
[<i>Takes some of the jewels, and offers them to</i>
<span class="smcap">Olivia</span>; <i>she strikes them down</i>: Lord
<span class="smcap">Plausible</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Novel</span> <i>take them up.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> So it seems, by giving her the cabinet.</p>

<p><i>L. Plau.</i> These pendants appertain to your most
faithful humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> And this locket is mine; my earnest for love,
which she never paid: therefore my own again.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> By what law, sir, pray?&mdash;Cousin Olivia, a word.
What, do they make a seizure on your goods and chattels,
<i>vi et armis</i>? Make your demand, I say, and bring your
trover, bring your trover. I'll follow the law for you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And I my revenge. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Man.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>.] But 'tis, my friend, in your consideration
most, that I would have returned part of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
wife's portion; for 'twere hard to take all from thee, since
thou hast paid so dear for't, in being such a rascal. Yet
thy wife is a fortune without a portion; and thou art a
man of that extraordinary merit in villany, the world and
fortune can never desert thee, though I do; therefore be
not melancholy. Fare you well, sir.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Vernish</span>
<i>doggedly.</i>] Now, madam, I beg your pardon [<i>Turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Fidelia</span>] for lessening the present I made you; but my
heart can never be lessened. This, I confess, was too
small for you before; for you deserve the Indian world;
and I would now go thither, out of covetousness for
your sake only.</p>

<p><i>Fid.</i> Your heart, sir, is a present of that value, I can
never make any return to't.&mdash;[<i>Pulling</i> <span class="smcap">Manly</span> <i>from the
company.</i>] But I can give you back such a present as
this, which I got by the loss of my father, a gentleman of
the north, of no mean extraction, whose only child I
was, therefore left me in the present possession of two
thousand pounds a-year; which I left, with multitudes of
pretenders, to follow you, sir; having in several public
places seen you, and observed your actions thoroughly,
with admiration, when you were too much in love to take
notice of mine, which yet was but too visible. The
name of my family is Grey, my other Fidelia. The rest
of my story you shall know when I have fewer auditors.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, now, madam, you have taken from me all
power of making you any compliment on my part; for I
was going to tell you, that for your sake only I would
quit the unknown pleasure of a retirement; and rather
stay in this ill world of ours still, though odious to me,
than give you more frights again at sea, and make again
too great a venture there, in you alone. But if I should
tell you now all this, and that your virtue (since greater
than I thought any was in the world) had now reconciled
me to't, my friend here would say, 'tis your estate that hast
made me friends with the world.</p>

<p><i>Free.</i> I must confess I should; for I think most of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
quarrels to the world are just such as we have to a handsome
woman; only because we cannot enjoy her as we
would do.</p>

<p><i>Man.</i> Nay, if thou art a plain dealer too, give me thy
hand; for now I'll say, I am thy friend indeed; and for
your two sakes, though I have been so lately deceived in
friends of both sexes,&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Macaulay's version of the above story is derived from Spence's
<i>Anecdotes.</i> It differs entirely from Dennis's version, which is
evidently the correct one, as the former totally misses the point,
and makes the Duchess guilty merely of a piece of unmeaning
rudeness. Dennis's account is as follows.&mdash;"The writing of that
Play [<i>Love in a Wood</i>] was the Occasion of his becoming acquainted
with one of King Charles's Mistresses after a very particular manner.
As Mr. Wycherley was going thro' <i>Pall Mall</i> towards <i>St. James's</i>
in his Chariot, he met the foresaid lady in hers, who, thrusting
half her Body out of the Chariot, cry'd out aloud to him, 'You,
Wycherley, you are a Son of a Whore,' at the same time laughing
aloud and heartily.... Mr. Wycherley was certainly very much
surpriz'd at it, yet not so much but he soon apprehended it was
spoke with Allusion to the latter End of a Song in the foremention'd
Play&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Great Wits and great Braves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have always a Punk to their Mother.'</span><br />
</p>
<p>
As, during Mr. Wycherley's Surprize, the Chariots drove different
ways, they were soon at a considerable Distance from each other,
when Mr. Wycherley, recovering from his Surprize, ordered his
Coachman to drive back, and to overtake the Lady. As soon as he
got over-against her, he said to her, 'Madam, you have been
pleased to bestow a title on me which generally belongs to the
Fortunate. Will your Ladyship be at the Play to-night?' 'Well,'
she reply'd, 'what if I am there?' 'Why, then I will be there to
wait on your Ladyship, tho' I disappoint a very fine Woman who
has made me an Assignation.' 'So,' said she, 'you are sure to disappoint
a Woman who has favour'd you for one who has not.'
'Yes,' reply'd he, 'if she who has not favour'd me is the finer
Woman of the two. But he who will be constant to your Ladyship,
till he can find a finer Woman, is sure to die your Captive.' The
Lady blush'd, and bade her Coachman drive away.... In short,
she was that Night in the first Row of the King's Box in 'Drury
Lane,' and Mr. Wycherley in the Pit under her, where he entertain'd
her during the whole Play." Dennis's <i>Familiar Letters</i>,
London, 1721.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This anecdote is given by Leigh Hunt on the authority of
Voltaire's <i>Letters concerning the English Nation</i>. But Leigh
Hunt's memory appears to have played him false. The only
allusion, in Voltaire's <i>Letters</i>, to the connection between Wycherley
and the Duchess, is contained in the following words:&mdash;"Mr.
Wycherley, who was a long Time known publickly to be happy in
the good Graces of the most celebrated Mistress of King Charles the
Second."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Wycherley accordingly journeyed into France, about the
beginning of the winter of 1678, and returned, entirely restored, at
the end of the following spring. The King received him with the
utmost favour, and made choice of him as governor to his son. It
was immediately after this that Wycherley went down to Tunbridge
(in the summer of 1679), where he met the Countess of Drogheda,
whom he soon afterwards married.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes that the battle at which Wycherley
was present was that which the Duke of York gained over Opdam,
in 1665. We believe that it was one of the battles between Rupert
and De Ruyter, in 1673.
</p>
<p>
The point is of no importance; and there cannot be said to be
much evidence either way. We offer, however, to Mr. Leigh Hunt's
consideration three arguments&mdash;of no great weight certainly&mdash;yet
such as ought, we think, to prevail in the absence of better. First,
it is not very likely that a young Templar, quite unknown in the
world&mdash;and Wycherley was such in 1665&mdash;should have quitted his
chambers to go to sea. On the other hand, it would have been in
the regular course of things that, when a courtier and an equerry,
he should offer his services. Secondly, his verses appear to have
been written after a drawn battle, like those of 1673, and not after
a complete victory, like that of 1665. Thirdly, in the epilogue to
<i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>, written in 1673, he says that "all
gentlemen must pack to sea;" an expression which makes it
probable that he did not himself mean to stay behind. The
epilogue to <i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i> was probably written
about the end of 1671. See the Introduction to that play.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

lines, and did not dream of its being inserted but just before: when

thank you very much: pray blot it out.'"&mdash;Pope, in Spence's
<i>Anecdotes.</i>
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere Pope states that he was forty years of age when the
illness occurred. It is possible that this illness may have been the
fever before mentioned, from which he sought recovery by travel, in
the winter of 1678; though Dennis certainly describes him as
returning "entirely restored," both in body and mind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Our information respecting the closing scene of Wycherley's
life is too scanty for the formation of a definite judgment. We are,
however, under no necessity of believing the circumstances which
attended it to have been in any way scandalous. Pope's letter, on
this occasion, to Mr. Blount is here subjoined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jan. 21, 1715-16.</p>

<p>"I know of nothing that will be so interesting to you at
present, as some circumstances of the last act of that eminent comic
poet, and our friend, Wycherley. He had often told me, as I
doubt not he did all his acquaintance, that he would marry as soon
as his life was despaired of. Accordingly, a few days before his
death, he underwent the ceremony: and joined together those two
sacraments, which, wise men say, should be the last we receive:
for, if you observe, matrimony is placed after extreme unction in
our catechism, as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they
are to be taken. The old man then lay down, satisfied in the
conscience of having by this one act paid his just debts, obliged a
woman, who, he was told, had merit, and shown an heroic resentment
of the ill-usage of his next heir. Some hundred pounds,
which he had with the lady, discharged those debts: a jointure of
four hundred a year made her a recompense; and the nephew he
left to comfort himself as well as he could, with the miserable
remains of a mortgaged estate. I saw our friend twice after this
was done, less peevish in his sickness than he used to be in his
health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been
more likely) much ashamed of marrying. The evening before he
expired, he called his young wife to the bedside, and earnestly
entreated her not to deny him one request, the last he should make.
Upon her assurances of consenting to it, he told her, 'My dear, it
is only this, that you will never marry an old man again.' I cannot
help remarking, that sickness, which often destroys both wit and
wisdom, yet seldom has power to remove that talent which we call
humour. Mr. Wycherley shewed his, even in this last compliment;
though I think his request a little hard, for why should he
bar her from doubling her jointure on the same easy terms.
</p>
<p>
"So trivial as these circumstances are, I should not be displeased
myself to know such trifles, when they concern or characterise any
eminent person. The wisest and wittiest of men are seldom wiser
or wittier than others in these sober moments. At least, our friend
ended much in the character he had lived in: and Horace's rule for
a play may as well be applied to him as a play-wright:
</p>
<p>'&mdash;&mdash;<i>Servetur ad imum</i><br />
<i>Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.</i>'<br />
</p>
<p>
"I am, &amp;c."</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is stated that the lady's name was Jackson, and that she
brought Wycherley a fortune of £1,500. The following additional
particulars are given, on the authority of Pope, in Spence's <i>Anecdotes</i>,
"Wycherley's nephew, on whom his estate was entailed (but with
power to settle a widow's jointure) would not consent to his selling
any part of it; which he wanted much to do, to pay his debts,
about a thousand pounds. He had therefore long resolved to marry,
in order to make a settlement from the estate, to pay off his debts
with his wife's fortune, and 'to plague his damned nephew,' as he
used to express it.... After all, the woman he did marry
proved a cheat; was a cast mistress of the person who recommended
her to him; and was supplied by him with money for her wedding
clothes." This last assertion is hardly to be reconciled with the
assumption that Wycherley paid his debts with his wife's fortune.
From an allusion to his nephew's "ill-carriage" to him, in a letter
to Pope, dated Aug. 11, 1709, we gather that the quarrel between
them was of old standing; of its origin we are completely ignorant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> It is difficult to understand in what the impropriety of these
speeches is supposed to consist. They are both placed in the mouth
of Sparkish, an affected fop, whose utmost ambition is to be recorded
a wit, and to whom no sacrifice would seem excessive for
the sake of a smart saying. His indifference to the young lady in
question occasions his loss of her in the end.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Wycherley's "slowness" has been denied by both Pope and
Lansdowne. The former declares that "he was far from being
slow in general, and, in particular, wrote <i>The Plain Dealer</i> in
three weeks." And Lansdowne observes, "If it had been a
trouble to him to write, I am much mistaken if he would not have
spared himself that trouble." It seems certain, however, that he
revised and altered his plays before committing them to the public,
and he by no means belonged to the class of so-called Easy Writers,
with respect to whom a <i>bon-mot</i> of his is recorded in the ninth
<i>Tatler</i>. "The town has for half an age been tormented with
insects called Easy Writers, whose abilities Mr. Wycherley one
day described excellently well in one word: 'That,' said he,
'among these fellows is called Easy Writing, which anyone may

the Mall in St. James's Park, upon the site now occupied by
Buckingham Palace and its grounds. Its name was derived from a
plantation of mulberry trees which James I. caused to be made
there. Later, the spot was converted into a public garden, with
shrubberies, walks, arbours, and a house of refreshment, and was
much frequented by persons of fashion as well as citizens. Pepys
found it "a very silly place, worse than Spring-garden," but "a
wilderness here that is somewhat pretty." The following extract
from Sedley's <i>Mulberry Garden</i> gives an idea of the doings at this
place. The scene is laid in the Garden:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"<i>Wildish.</i> What, is there store of game here, gentlemen?
</p>
<p>
<i>Modish.</i> Troth, little or none; a few citizens that have brought
their children out to air 'em, and eat cheesecakes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wildish.</i> I thought this place had been so full of beauties, that
like a pack of hounds in a hare warren, you could hunt one for
another: what think you of an arbor and a bottle of Rhenish?"</p></div>

Lincoln's Inn Fields and Holborn. The character of its inhabitants
had given it at this time an ill reputation. In Crowne's comedy of
the <i>Country Wit</i> (1675) occurs the following allusion to Whetstone's
Park: "After I had gone a little way in a great broad street, I
turned into a Tavern hard by a place they call a Park; and just as
our Park is all Trees, that Park is all Houses. I asked if they had
any Deer in it, and they told me, not half so many as they used to
have; but that if I had a mind to a Doe, they would put a Doe
to me."</p></div>

1859. Pepys has an interesting entry concerning it, under date
of May 28, 1667; "I by water to Fox-hall, and there walked in
Spring-garden. A great deal of company, and the weather and
garden pleasant: and it is very pleasant and cheap going thither,
for a man may go to spend what he will, or nothing, all as one.

Jones, extended, like the modern piazza, along the northern and

same famous architect, and on the south the square was bordered
by the gardens of Bedford House. "The area was inclosed with
railings, at sixty feet from the buildings; and in the centre was a
dial, with a gilt ball, raised upon a column." <i>Timbs' Curiosities of

before <i>The Plain Dealer</i>. The former was produced in 1668. This
supposed discovery of a non-existent coincidence appears to have
arisen from a misinterpretation of Voltaire's words in the French
edition of his <i>Letters concerning the English Nation</i>: "On a encore
lardé cette piece (<i>The Plain Dealer</i>) d'une Comtesse de Pimbesche,
vieille plaideuse." But Voltaire clearly employs the title of
"Comtesse de Pimbesche" only as a generic term for a litigious

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
